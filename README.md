**prabhav**(translates ~ "*impact*") is a non-profit effort dedicated to leveraging technologies including like AI and more to change things in society for the better.


our first initiative is aimed to serve the masses in india with easy & accessible information about govt. schemes in a convenient way using an AI whatsapp chatbot (given its huge existing reach); information though openly available, is largely inaccessible to most rural & average citizens due to lack of working knowledge & ease of ascess.

we're trying to do our bit. users can chat in their own langauage and get info about all the schemes they can avail benefits from.
