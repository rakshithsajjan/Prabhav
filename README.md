# Prabhav AI / प्रभाव
**Prabhav AI**(translates ~ "*impact*") is a non-profit organization dedicated to leveraging artificial intelligence to achieve societal, economic, and environmental advancements.


Our first initiative, called "Prabhav-chat" is aimed to serve under-privileged masses in India with easy & accessible information about Govt. Schemes in a convenient way using an AI whatsapp chatbot (given its existing reach among rural India).

Information though openly available, is largely inaccessible to most rural & under-privileged Indians due to lack of working knowledge on how to access it. 


Prabhav will remove that barrier by giving a multilingual chatbot right in their whatsapp app. Users can chat in their own langauage and get info about all the schemes they can avail benefits from. 

Me and [Sujant](https://x.com/sujantkumarkv) had this idea since a year but left it brewing in the back of our minds. We are now focusing on it and we will be rolling out multilingual voice input as well. 

Tasks:
- [x] Scrape [Myschemes](https://www.myscheme.gov.in) (issues with links embedded in text)
- [ ] Implement Chatbot in Whatsapp
- [ ] Implement Voice input
