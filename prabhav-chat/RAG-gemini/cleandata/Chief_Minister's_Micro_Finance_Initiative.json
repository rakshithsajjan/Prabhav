To that end, he stated that the government will grant either a subsidy or an interest subsidy to specified activities in agriculture and associated sectors, such as processing units, handicrafts, and small-scale manufacturing. Additional interest subvention would be offered in addition to what is already available under existing Central Government schemes. The programme will assist farmers in increasing their revenues, promoting credit discipline, encouraging private entrepreneurship, and improving our state's agri-marketing network and infrastructure. Beneficiaries will be chosen by District Level Selection Committees, with Village Councils acting as guarantors when necessary. The scheme's precise framework will be announced separately.",
