        "details": "In Maharashtra, group supply of goat and sheep refers to a collective approach taken by small-scale farmers to supply their livestock to larger markets. These farmers form groups or cooperatives to pool their resources and negotiate better prices for their goats and sheep. Group supply is often used for the purpose of reducing costs, improving access to markets, and promoting efficient utilization of resources. The species of goats and sheep commonly found in Maharashtra include Jamunapari, Beetal, and Sirohi, among others. Group supply of goats and sheep is an important aspect of the livestock industry in Maharashtra, contributing to both the economy and food security of the region. The group supply system has several advantages for small-scale farmers, including reduced transportation costs, improved market access, and increased bargaining power. By working together, farmers can also share knowledge and resources, such as veterinary services and animal feed. Overall, group supply of goat and sheep is an important component of the agricultural economy in Maharashtra, supporting small-scale farmers and providing a valuable source of meat to consumers.",
