        "details": "Karnataka Forest Department initiated ‘Krushi Aranya Protsaha Yojane (KAPY)’ in 2011-12 in order to promote the cooperation of farmers and the general public in the task of increasing forest and tree cover. As per the program, farmers are provided seedlings at subsidized rates from the nearest nurseries of the Forest Department for planting in their lands. The farmers are paid an amount of Rs 35 as an incentive for every surviving seedling at the end of the first year. A sum of Rs 40 and Rs 50 per seedling is provided for each surviving seedling after the completion of the second and third year respectively. The incentive is given to encourage the farmer not only to plant the seedlings but also to nurture them at least for three years. The total amount of money provided (Rs 125/- per seedling) more than compensates the cost incurred by the farmer in procuring and planting the seedling. The incentive is quite substantial when the farmer plants more seedlings. Apart from getting the financial incentive, the farmers are entitled to get handsome returns from the grown-up trees in various forms such as fruits, seeds, fodder, firewood, pole, timber, etc.",
