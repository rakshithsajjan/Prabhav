        "details": "Recognizing the importance of menstrual hygiene management, the Uttarakhand government's Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development introduced the 'Sanitary Napkin Scheme,' a social security initiative focused on adolescent girls and women. This program tackles the issue of period poverty by making sanitary napkins readily available at a subsidized cost. By ensuring affordability, the scheme empowers girls and women to manage their menstrual cycles hygienically and confidently. This not only promotes good health but also allows them to participate fully in all aspects of daily life, including education and work. The 'Sanitary Napkin Scheme' serves as a significant step towards breaking the silence around menstruation and fostering a culture of menstrual health awareness in Uttarakhand.",
