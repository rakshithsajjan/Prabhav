        "details": "The “Mangalya Scheme” was launched by the Department of Women and Child Development, Government of Kerala. Under the scheme, financial assistance is to be provided to eligible widows and divorced women for their remarriage. In Kerala, women not only outnumber men but also outlive them, so the marital status of women in Kerala is very important. It could influence the overall care and support they receive from their family and society. Statics show only 3.5% of the total male population in Kerala are widowers and the proportion of the widowed female population is 11.56%. This gender gap adversely affects women in every sphere of their life. It is in this context, that the Government of Kerala envisages the scheme called ‘Mangalya’ to encourage widow remarriage. The scheme imparts financial assistance for the widows/divorced to remarry.",
