Due to poverty and lack of resources of the parents, such children are not able to take admission in any school or are not able to continue their education after taking admission. Realizing the need to start residential schools for such children of construction workers, a residential school scheme has been proposed. The objective of the scheme is to provide quality education to the children of registered construction workers in the age group of 6 to 14 years by providing them the facilities of primary, junior high school and secondary education. Initially, residential school scheme will be operated in districts Etawah, Bhadohi, Kannauj, Moradabad, Firozabad, Lalitpur, Bahraich, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Azamgarh, Agra and Meerut. Later, based on the experiences and needs gained, this scheme will be expanded to other districts.",
