        "details": "Kerala is a state well known for its efficient and effective health care system. Despite these advancements, much headway could not be made in-home care. Most of the lowest income group always opt for homely treatment as they cannot afford the charges levied by the well-known hospitals. They are bedridden causing a heavy social burden on their family members who are forced to stay back at home to look after these bedridden patients. While the upper-income group can possibly afford to engage paid caregivers or home nurses for looking after such bedridden family members, the lower-income group usually take it upon themselves to care for their bedridden brethren. These family members in fact function as informal caregivers, without due recognition or economic gain.",
