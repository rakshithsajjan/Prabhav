        "department": "Government of Uttar Pradesh",
        "type": "Training Scheme",
        "beneficiary": "Registered construction workers",
        "details": "This scheme aims to address the skill gap faced by construction workers registered with the Board by providing them with access to essential training opportunities for competency development and technical advancement. Currently, construction workers rely solely on on-the-job experience, lacking formal technical training due to institutional limitations. This hinders their ability to secure fair wages and access better services. Recognizing the financial constraints often preventing workers and their families from pursuing formal training, this scheme offers reimbursement for both training costs and lost wages. By bridging this financial gap, the initiative empowers individuals to elevate their skillsets and career prospects.",
