        "type": "Grant",
        "beneficiary": "Female candidates",
        "details": "A Research Grant by MoST for female candidates to pursue research in frontier areas of science and engineering, preferably those having a break in career (minimum two years) and not having regular employment, to explore possibility of re-entry into the profession. This scheme will provide a research grant for a well-defined project proposal for a period of maximum three years. This grant will cover the fellowship of the applicant and cost of small equipments, contingencies, travel, consumables, etc. Institutional overhead charges will be extra. The support is available in 5 disciplines under WOS-A namely, i) Physical & Mathematical Sciences (PMS), ii) Chemical Sciences (CS), iii) Life Sciences (LS), iv) Earth & Atmospheric Sciences (EAS), and v) Engineering Technology (ET). The scheme plays pivotal role in gender mainstreaming as it not only prevents brain drain from S&T system but also train and retain women in the system. The scheme initially offers opportunity to work as bench-level scientists and ultimately open new avenues for permanent position in Science & Technology.",
