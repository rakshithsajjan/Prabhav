        "details": "INSPIRE INTERNSHIP aims to provide exposure to the top 1% of students at the Class X Board level by organizing Science Camps either during summer or winter which provides an opportunity for them to interact with Science icons from India and abroad, including Nobel Laureates, to experience the joys of scientific pursuit. These science camps nourish the curiosity of students in science, help them to think out-of-the-box, and attract students at an early age of 16-17 years to choose science subjects for further studies. Annually 50,000 students who are among the top one percent in their X Board Examination and pursuing science in standard XI would be benefited through summer/ winter camps.",
