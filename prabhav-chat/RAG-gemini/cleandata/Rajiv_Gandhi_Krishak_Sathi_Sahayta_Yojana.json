Farmers, farmworkers, and market staff face inherent risks in their daily activities. This program acknowledges those risks and provides much-needed financial assistance in times of crisis. If an accident occurs while they're tending to crops, raising livestock, or selling their produce at market, the Yojana can help soften the financial blow.
