Launched in 2013 under the auspices of the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, this visionary scheme aims to extend crucial financial assistance to persons with disabilities (PwDs) across the state. It operates as a lifeline for individuals grappling with various disabilities, ensuring their financial security and enabling them to lead dignified lives.
