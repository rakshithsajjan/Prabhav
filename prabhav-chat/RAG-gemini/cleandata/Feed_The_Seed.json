The program is designed to encourage farmers to produce their own seeds by providing them with free, high-quality seeds of various crops. Under this program, farmers are provided with a seed kit containing seeds of various crops, including vegetables, pulses, cereals, and oilseeds. The kit also contains instructions on how to grow and harvest the crops, as well as guidelines on seed production and storage. The program is based on the concept of 'Seed Village' where farmers can produce high-quality seeds and sell them in the market. The program encourages the use of sustainable agricultural practices such as crop rotation, organic farming, and conservation of traditional crop varieties. The aim of the Feed for Seed program is to increase the availability of high-quality seeds at affordable prices, promote sustainable agriculture practices, and empower farmers to become self-sufficient in seed production.",
