        "details": "The “Shramyogi Home Town Scheme” is implemented by the Gujarat Labour Welfare Board, Labour, Skill Development & Employment Department, Government of Gujarat. The objective of the scheme is to facilitate the payment of railway fares for migrant labourers employed in the organized sector in Gujarat, enabling them to travel to or from their home country to the nearest railway station. Considering the stagnant pace of industrial development in the state of Gujarat, some labourers come from other regions for livelihood. Most of these Shramyogis live away from their families. Due to social or accidental reasons, the economic burden of going to and from the labourers to their native place cannot be compensated by short salary. Hence, the plan for a labourer to visit his hometown once in two years.",
