This support often comes in the form of monthly stipends or welfare programs designed to meet their basic needs, including food, shelter, and healthcare. By extending financial aid, governments or charitable organizations seek to empower these vulnerable individuals to become more self-reliant and regain their footing in society. Additionally, such assistance may include access to vocational training or educational opportunities to enhance their skills and employability, fostering long-term independence. Ultimately, these initiatives contribute to fostering social inclusion and reducing poverty among widows and destitute women, ensuring they have the necessary support to rebuild their lives with dignity.",
