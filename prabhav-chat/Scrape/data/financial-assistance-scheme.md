Financial assistance is provided in three broad areas, namely: Development of Export Infrastructure, Quality Development, and Market Development. (i) Development of Export Infrastructure: APEDA recognizes the importance of infrastructure for the growth of agro-industries and the export of agricultural products in the value chain. The scheme component covers both fresh produce and processed food products. The objective of the scheme is to reduce losses caused due to spoilage and to ensure quality production of agro products. To achieve this, it seeks to set up post-harvest handling facilities.
