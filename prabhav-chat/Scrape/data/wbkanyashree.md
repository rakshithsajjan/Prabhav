[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/wbkanyashree#details)

**Kanyashree Prakalpa seeks to improve the status and well-being of girls, specifically those from socio-economically disadvantaged families through Conditional Cash Transfers by:**

﻿

Incentivizing them to continue in education for a longer period, and complete secondary or higher secondary education, or equivalent in technical or vocational steams, thereby giving them a better footing in both the economic and social spheres.

﻿

Disincentivizing marriage till at least the age of 18, the legal age of marriage, thereby reducing the risks of early pregnancies, associated risks of maternal and child mortality, and other debilitating health conditions, including that malnutrition.

﻿

It was also decided that the Scheme should confer more than just monetary support; it should be a means of financial inclusion and a tool of empowerment for adolescent girls. The scheme's benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls' names, leaving the decision of utilizing the money in their hands.

﻿

To reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behavior change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions, and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment.

﻿

As more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to help them become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social and emotional development will give them a better foundation for their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it is expected that the practice of child marriage will be completely eradicated. Women will attain their right to health, education, and socio-economic equality.

﻿

**The main objective of the scheme is to prevent child marriage and promote education among girls. It also aims to improve the health and nutrition of girls and empower them by building their skills and capacities.**

﻿

The scheme is implemented through a network of school teachers, community workers, and government officials. The scheme has been recognized as a best practice in girl-child empowerment by the United Nations.

﻿

Overall, the Kanyashree Prakalpa scheme has been successful in promoting the education and well-being of girls in West Bengal and has been replicated in other parts of the country.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/wbkanyashree#benefits)

The scheme offers two types of benefits - annual scholarships and one-time grants:

﻿

Annual scholarships: Girls who are studying in classes 8 to 12 in government-aided or recognized schools can apply for a yearly scholarship of Rs. 750. The scholarship is renewable every year, subject to the girl's continued enrollment and performance.

﻿

One-time grants: Girls who have completed 18 years of age and are unmarried can apply for a one-time grant of Rs. 25,000. The grant is provided to support the girl's higher education or vocational training.
