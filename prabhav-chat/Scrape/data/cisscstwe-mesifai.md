[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/cisscstwe-mesifai#faqs)

What measures are in place to address challenges related to fund availability for single installment disbursement?

In case single installment disbursement is not possible due to fund constraints, disbursement may be made in installments, addressing challenges related to fund availability.

Can units expect timely disbursement of subsidies, or is it subject to the availability of funds?

The subsidy is disbursed upon the availability of funds during the financial year, and if funds are insufficient, disbursement may be made in the next financial year.

Are there any specific criteria for units set up by the same person or group to be considered as separate entities for subsidy eligibility?

For units set up by the same person or group to be considered as separate entities, they must have distinct locations, products, and obtain licenses or clearances separately.

How does the scheme contribute to the creation of additional fixed assets or working capital for industrial units?

The subsidy amount, when disbursed through financial institutions/banks, is adjusted against the loan availed by entrepreneurs, facilitating the creation of additional fixed assets or supporting working capital requirements.

Can units apply for subsidies for activities beyond land, building, and machinery investments?

No, the scheme specifies exclusions, and investments in working capital, commissioning fees, goodwill fees, and other specified categories are not eligible for subsidies.

How does the scheme encourage the use of second-hand machinery, and what documentation is required for units opting for this?

Units can use second-hand machinery, and the investment is considered based on the initial purchase value with depreciation or the assessed value by a Chartered Engineer. An affidavit stating that the subsidy hasn't been availed from other sources is required.

What role does the State Level Committee play in the processing of applications for various subsidies?

The State Level Committee evaluates each case to determine whether the unit qualifies for the grant of incentive/subsidy, specifically for Capital Investment Subsidy and Infrastructure Subsidy.

Can units apply for multiple subsidies under different schemes simultaneously?

A unit that has availed investment subsidy from Central Government or any other agency is not eligible to apply for the same investment subsidy under this scheme.

How does the scheme contribute to the overall economic development of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, and Women Entrepreneurs?

By providing subsidies for investments in key areas, the scheme promotes economic development, entrepreneurship, and empowerment among Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, and Women Entrepreneurs.

What is the refund process for the subsidy, and when does it become applicable?

The subsidy is refundable with interest if obtained through misrepresentation, forgery, or if the unit remains non-operational for five years from the subsidy receipt. The Director of Industries and Commerce issues a registered demand notice for refund.

Who determines the quantum of incentive/subsidy admissible to the unit, and when is it disbursed?

The Committee decides the quantum of incentive/subsidy, and disbursal occurs upon the availability of funds during the financial year.
