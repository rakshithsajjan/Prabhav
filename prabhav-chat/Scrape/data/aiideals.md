[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/aiideals#details)

AICTE has decided to establish IDEA (Idea Development, Evaluation & Application) Lab in AICTE approved institutions, encouraging students for application of science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) fundamentals towards enhanced hands-on experience, learning by doing and even product visualization. As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can facilitate the students and faculty to “engage, explore, experience, express and excel” as desired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in the wake of release of National Educational Policy 2020,

> **Purpose:**

*   The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc. which conventional labs are not able to.

*   The focus will be on training students so that they become imaginative and creative and stay so at the workplaces they join. The whole idea is to transform engineering education with such a Lab in all colleges and for this they must proactively expose all students to the IDEA Lab, organize training sessions for interested students as well as support projects and by providing online learning materials.

> **Proposal:**

*   As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation, mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty, utilization and expansion of facilities, etc.
*   The alignment of activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge for any proposal.
*   Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by AICTE.

> **Implementation:**

The college/ educational campus/ university and industry are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE or even exceed it, in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally requires:

*   An area of 5000 sq. ft.
*   Should ideally remain open 24x7.
*   To be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem.
*   To hold workshops/ trainings, ideation sessions, boot-camps, competitions etc. and participate in similar activities organized by other IDEA Labs/ organizers and also in national/ international events so as to ensure that IDEA Lab is used productively and also extensively.
*   To maintain the IDEA Lab, keep it well-furnished, take care of security, provide a safe working environment and stock adequate supplies of consumables.
*   To provide necessary staff and all support facilities and amenities required to operate and maintain the Lab.
*   To follow the guidelines issued by AICTE in the matter of IDEA Lab and other Government of India rules besides following the enunciated Code of Conduct (as in Annexures) in letter and spirit.

[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/aiideals#faqs)

What is IDEA Lab scheme?

The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc.

For whom the IDEA Lab is meant?

IDEA Lab is meant for students and faculty of the college/ educational campus/University.

Which institutions are eligible for applying for AICTE IDEA Lab?

Institutions (including part of educational campuses or universities) more than 10 years old are eligible for applying and must have at least one course accredited by the NBA.

What type of civil infrastructure is required for an IDEA Lab?

Ideally, a built up area of 5000 sq. ft. is required. But the institution must agree to provide a minimum built-up and furnished space of 2000 sq. ft. for the laboratory and an additional 1000 sq. ft. to facilitate activities under IDEA Lab. The installation of equipment has to be done taking into account all safety and environmental concerns.

What hardware constitutes an IDEA Lab?

In order to support do-it-yourself activities and facilitate translation of ideas into prototypes, each IDEA Lab must be equipped with tools, components and consumables. Equipment and consumables have been identified (in Annexure ) and tools (in Annexure I1) which need to be there for a fully functional IDEA Lab as a complete unit.

Can the institute contribute in raising IDEA Lab through existing equipment?

The institution can shift permanently equipment/ tools they may be having with them to the IDEA Lab. However, they will not be included in the budget but reflected in the inventory.

Can more than one institution join?

The utilization of facilities for the purpose they are given, to the maximum extent, is of paramount concern for AICTE. Towards this, institutions can come together under a lead institution which is eligible to apply. The Lab has to be in the premises of the lead institution which will be responsible for executing the project and ensuring that participating institutions and industries are not a liability on IDEA Lab/ Institution.

Can the entire non-AICTE funding be from the institution?

Yes, the contribution can be from college but this is an excellent opportunity to reach out to industry inviting them for a national initiative. With gates opened for industry, the revenue generation and hence, prospects for sustenance of Lab enhance significantly. This is besides the live problems/ challenges they can offer to the colleges and technical experts as well.

Who operates and manages IDEA Lab?

The Head of Institute will be the ex-officio Chief Mentor (CM) of the AICTE IDEA Lab, responsible for overall implementation of the project.

How are Student Ambassadors to be selected?

Students from the 3rd/ 4th year of UG or any year of PG course who show keen interest in the activities and regularly participate in them, can be nominated. Institute can frame its own set of rules for this. Upto 3 Ambassadors can be there at a time and should be rotated, maintaining gender equity.

How can other faculty make use of the facilities?

IDEA Labis as much to be used by faculty, as students, including for their research work. They can work on their ideas independently or by involving students. They can create internship projects or practical work which require significant use of IDEA Lab and also facilities in their own departments. Working on interdisciplinary projects involving IDEA Lab would be appreciated.

Can the institution put in place a committee for implementation of the IDEA Lab project?

It's the prerogative of the institution to have one, as an internal mechanism. However, it should in no way become an impediment, at any stage, in the functioning of the Lab.

Can more than one industry join?

As long as interested industries are an asset and not a liability on IDEA Lab/ Institution, they are welcome to contribute and participate. They can be given preference over non-contributing industries, in making use of the facilities of IDEA Lab.

Can we charge the users of IDEA Lab?

Users other than students and faculty can be charged. Revenue generation will be a performance indicator and is strongly encouraged, for sustenance of the Lab. Faculty/ teachers/ staff attending the courses organized by the Lab, which earn a certificate useful for career advancement, can be charged nominally. There can be differential charges for users of facilities and those for a course/ training.

When and how will AICTE release funds?

AICTE will release 80% of sanctioned amount as first instalment only after matching grant is deposited in the exclusive Bank Account of IDEA Lab and proof submitted. The second instalment of 20% will be released based on the (a) performance (b) utilization of AICTE's first instalment (c) deposition of 20% amount from non-AICTE sources and any other funds committed in the sanctioned project, besides other documents stipulated for fund release.

Frequently Asked Questions

AICTE has decided to establish IDEA (Idea Development, Evaluation & Application) Lab in AICTE approved institutions, encouraging students for application of science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) fundamentals towards enhanced hands-on experience, learning by doing and even product visualization. As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can facilitate the students and faculty to “engage, explore, experience, express and excel” as desired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in the wake of release of National Educational Policy 2020,

> **Purpose:**

*   The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc. which conventional labs are not able to.

*   The focus will be on training students so that they become imaginative and creative and stay so at the workplaces they join. The whole idea is to transform engineering education with such a Lab in all colleges and for this they must proactively expose all students to the IDEA Lab, organize training sessions for interested students as well as support projects and by providing online learning materials.

> **Proposal:**

*   As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation, mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty, utilization and expansion of facilities, etc.
*   The alignment of activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge for any proposal.
*   Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by AICTE.

> **Implementation:**

The college/ educational campus/ university and industry are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE or even exceed it, in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally requires:

*   An area of 5000 sq. ft.
*   Should ideally remain open 24x7.
*   To be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem.
*   To hold workshops/ trainings, ideation sessions, boot-camps, competitions etc. and participate in similar activities organized by other IDEA Labs/ organizers and also in national/ international events so as to ensure that IDEA Lab is used productively and also extensively.
*   To maintain the IDEA Lab, keep it well-furnished, take care of security, provide a safe working environment and stock adequate supplies of consumables.
*   To provide necessary staff and all support facilities and amenities required to operate and maintain the Lab.
*   To follow the guidelines issued by AICTE in the matter of IDEA Lab and other Government of India rules besides following the enunciated Code of Conduct (as in Annexures) in letter and spirit.
