Why is the application form allowing me to apply to 3 incubators?

The scheme aims to maximize the chances of each startup applicant getting supported through seed funds. It also aims to give startups an opportunity to get supported by a relevant incubator that can give the necessary guidance to them. Thus, we give startups an option to apply to 3 different incubators according to their preference. For example, if incubators at Preference 1 and Preference 2 both select a startup, the funding shall be given by Preference 1 incubator. If Preference 1 incubator rejects and Preference 2 incubator selects, the funding shall be given by incubator at Preference 2, and so on.

How do I choose the incubators to apply to?

The incubator preference should be filled at the startup applicants’ discretion. Applicants can choose incubators basis their sector, stage, business needs, and strategic goals. Details of the incubators which are part of the scheme will be available on Seed Fund Portal soon.

We maintain confidentiality of all the proposals we receive under the scheme. Your application is only shared with the incubators you apply to for the purpose of evaluation, and with the EAC for the purpose of monitoring.

Do I need to be physically present at an incubator’s’ premises to avail seed funds under this scheme?

To apply for the scheme, it is not mandatory to be physically present at the incubator’s location. For startups being monitored virtually by the incubator, it is required for both parties to touch base every 30 days. This is to ensure that an incubator will be able to keep a check on the progress of the startup and a startup will be able to take guidance for their business from the incubator.

Can I apply to the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme again after receiving a rejection?

Yes, you can apply to the SISFS again after 3 months of receiving a rejection. This buffer time is given to ensure that you have worked on the feedback received from incubators and are ready to be considered again.

Who is going to review my application?

Application of each startup will be reviewed by an Incubator Seed Management Committee (ISMC) formed by the incubators you apply to. The committee will also be responsible for future assessment of the performance of the startup and disbursement of further tranches. Each ISMC constitutes of the following members: 1.

I had filled an order of preference for incubators while applying. Can I change this preference order after application?

Applications once filled and submitted are final. The preference order of the incubator cannot be changed at a later stage.

These updates should be shared on the scheme dashboard at least on a monthly basis. In case of milestone-based disbursements, startup shall submit the interim progress update and utilisation certificate to initiate the release of subsequent installment of grant. Startup shall also submit final report and audited utilisation certificate at the end of the project duration.

I have been selected for seed fund, but I would not like to take the process forward. What do I do?

A startup can choose to not avail the support being offered to them under the scheme. The procedure for the same depends on the stage of the startup in the application process. 1. If the startup has been selected and the seed funding has been approved, they will be required to write a short letter mentioning the reason to pull out of the process. Post the acknowledgment of the letter, they will find a cancel application button on the application tracker tab of their dashboard which will allow them to cancel their application. 2. If the startup has already received any seed fund, it will be required to write a short letter mentioning the reason to pull out of the process. Post acknowledgment of the letter, they will be required to return the fund within 15 days. Post the acknowledgment of refund, they will find a cancel application button on the application tracker tab of their dashboard.

What if my startup fails after receiving the seed fund? Will there be any liability on me or my company?

It is understood that every startup cannot be successful. The legal agreement that you sign with the incubator will have provisions related to failure of startups supported under the scheme. For failed ventures, the entrepreneur shall share his/her learnings and the reasons for failure in the report and submit this along with the utilization certificate for the fund amount.
