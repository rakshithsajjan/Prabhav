What is the role of the inspectors under the Act in the registration process?

Inspectors verify the authenticity of the registration and, upon approval by the Secretary (Board), enroll the concerned worker as a beneficiary of the scheme.

What is the timeline for submitting an application for "Funeral Assistance" after the death of the Construction Worker?

The application should be submitted within two months from the date of death of the Construction Worker.

How long does it take for the financial assistance to be credited after the application is submitted?

The financial assistance of ₹7,000/- is credited within 7 days through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).

It's been more than two months since my husband, a registered construction worker, passed away. Can I still apply for the Funeral Assistance scheme?

No, you cannot apply for the Funeral Assistance scheme if more than two months have passed since the date of the construction worker's death. The application needs to be submitted within two months to be considered.

I don't have the original last subscription bill of my deceased brother. Can I still apply for the Funeral Assistance scheme on his behalf?

While the original last subscription bill is listed as a required document, you can try reaching out to the Puducherry Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board to inquire about alternative options. They might accept a copy of the bill or a document proving your brother's contribution history.

Can the application be submitted to any office of the Puducherry Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board?

The given content specifies the office address (Industrial Estate, Thattanchavady, Puducherry - 605 009) for obtaining and submitting the forms, but it does not explicitly state whether it can be submitted to any office.

My father recently passed away, and I am his nominee. If I receive the Funeral Assistance, will it affect any other benefits I might be eligible for, such as the death benefit?

No, receiving the Funeral Assistance will not affect your eligibility for other benefits offered by the Board, such as the death benefit. You can apply for both schemes separately.

I submitted my application for the Funeral Assistance a month ago, but I haven't received the money yet. What should I do?

If you haven't received the Funeral Assistance within a reasonable timeframe (around a month after submission), you can contact the Puducherry Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board to inquire about the status of your application. The contact details and grievance redressal process are available in the Citizen's Charter on the Board's website.

Who is considered a dependent under the Funeral Assistance scheme?

The scheme defines dependents as the nominee mentioned in the registration form, spouse, and children (unmarried and unemployed) of the deceased construction worker.

My brother, a registered construction worker, passed away due to illness. Is his family still eligible for the Funeral Assistance scheme?

Yes, the cause of death (accident, illness, etc.) doesn't affect the eligibility for the Funeral Assistance scheme. As long as all other criteria are met, the dependents can apply for the benefit.

My uncle passed away a month and a half ago. We are still collecting some required documents for the application. Can we submit the application after the two-month deadline?

The two-month deadline for submitting the application is strictly enforced. However, you can try contacting the Board and explain your situation. They might consider your case on a compassionate basis, especially if the delay is due to genuine reasons and you can submit the application soon.
