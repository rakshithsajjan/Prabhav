[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/scsssetul#details)

The Dept. of Biotechnology (DBT) has launched a scheme "Star College Scheme for Strengthening of Science Education and Training at Undergraduate Level" for improving critical thinking and 'hands-on' experimental work at the undergraduate (college) level in sciences. It is expected to encourage, more students to take up higher education in science. DBT will identify colleges with ambition and potential for excellence and provide academic and physical infrastructure for achieving excellence in teaching and unique exposure of students to experimental science.

﻿

The Star College Scheme is a pan-India Scheme that envisages a Star College in every district of the country, thus the Department shall exert dialogues with the State Government and identify colleges that can be considered for support under this Scheme. DBT has supported over 200 undergraduate colleges across the country in the past 9 years. Apart from financial support, colleges benefit tremendously from guidance received in Advisory Committee Meetings, mentoring, Task Force Meetings, and learning from peers in other colleges.

When Is The Call For DBT Star College Scheme Announced?

The call for the DBT-Star College scheme for both Urban and Rural categories is announced annually and is advertised on the DBT website.

What Are The ‘Urban’ And ‘Rural’ Categories Of Colleges?

DBT is focused on the equitable percolation of benefits of the Star College Scheme throughout the country and is committed to ensuring that geographical location and access to means of communication and technology should not be a deterrent for securing this highly competitive grant. Therefore, since 2018-19 Colleges have been categorized into Urban and Rural categories based on the physical location of the college. Colleges applying under the Rural category should mandatorily attach a certificate (with the application) from competent authority (local administration and not the Principal of the College) either in Hindi or English stating that the college is located in a Rural area, failing which applications shall not be considered further.

Can A College Request Addition Of New Departments During The Ongoing Tenure Of Support?

Colleges requesting the addition of new departments should first complete one cycle of support i.e. 3 years with the departments that the grant was recommended for.

Who Can Be A Coordinator For A Star College Scheme?
