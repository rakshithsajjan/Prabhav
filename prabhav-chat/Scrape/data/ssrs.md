School Sanitation Reward Scheme
===============================

Sanitation

School

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ssrs#details)

The Government of Himachal Pradesh has implemented a comprehensive strategy, known as the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), to address the sanitation challenges in rural areas. This strategy has led to significant progress, with the state achieving almost universal sanitation coverage and all Panchayats claiming Open Defecation Free (ODF) status. To further incentivize and acknowledge exceptional efforts in the field of sanitation, the government introduced the Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP), Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorna Swachata Puraskar (MVSSP), and the School Sanitation Reward Scheme.

﻿

The School Sanitation Reward Scheme aims to enhance sanitation facilities and promote hygiene education in schools. Schools that meet the eligibility criteria, including the availability of toilets, urinals, hand washing facilities, safe drinking water, and waste management systems, can participate in the scheme. Assessment committees are formed at the block and district levels to evaluate schools based on specific criteria, and winners are selected accordingly. The scheme provides cash awards and certificates of appreciation to the cleanest primary, middle, and high/senior secondary schools at both block and district levels. The prize money is intended to be utilized for further improving sanitation facilities within the winning schools. With these initiatives, the government of Himachal Pradesh aims to foster sustainable sanitation practices and create a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations in the state's rural areas.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ssrs#benefits)

Improved Sanitation Facilities: The School Sanitation Reward Scheme encourages schools to enhance their sanitation facilities, including the availability of toilets, urinals, hand washing facilities, and waste management systems. This leads to improved hygiene practices and a healthier environment for students.

﻿

Hygiene Education: The scheme emphasizes the importance of hygiene education in schools. By participating in the scheme, schools are motivated to incorporate hygiene education into their curriculum, raising awareness among students about the significance of maintaining personal hygiene and cleanliness.

﻿

Behavioral Change: The scheme plays a crucial role in fostering behavioral change among students. By promoting good sanitation practices and hygiene education, it instills positive habits and attitudes towards sanitation, which can have long-term benefits in terms of overall health and well-being.

﻿

Healthy Learning Environment: Adequate sanitation facilities and hygiene practices create a healthy learning environment for students. Access to clean toilets, hand washing facilities, and safe drinking water reduces the risk of diseases, enhances student attendance, and improves concentration and academic performance.

﻿

Community Engagement: The School Sanitation Reward Scheme involves various stakeholders, such as teachers, school management, local NGOs, and Gram Panchayats. This promotes community engagement and collective efforts towards achieving sustainable sanitation goals, creating a sense of ownership and responsibility among all stakeholders.

﻿

Recognition and Motivation: The scheme provides recognition and incentives to schools that excel in sanitation and hygiene education. The cash awards and certificates of appreciation serve as motivation for schools to maintain and improve their sanitation facilities, fostering a healthy competitive spirit among educational institutions.

﻿

Sustainable Sanitation Practices: By integrating sanitation and hygiene education into the school system, the scheme aims to create a culture of sustainable sanitation practices. Students who are exposed to proper sanitation habits at an early age are likely to carry these practices into adulthood, contributing to the long-term goal of building a sustainable and hygienic society.

[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ssrs#eligibility)
