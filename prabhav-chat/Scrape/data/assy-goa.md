Is there a specific timeframe within which the applicant must apply for the scheme after the occurrence of death?

Yes, in cases where the applicant seeks assistance based on their relationship with a deceased Scheduled Tribe individual, the application must be made within 12 months from the time of the individual's death.

How does the scheme ensure that the applicants meet the eligibility criteria?

The scheme requires essential documents such as a Caste Certificate issued by the Competent Authority, Death Certificate of the deceased, Income Certificate issued by the Competent Authority, Ration Card, Election Card, and Aadhar Card. These documents collectively serve as evidence to verify the eligibility of the applicant and the deceased.

What is the maximum financial assistance offered under this scheme?

The scheme provides financial assistance of up to ₹ 20,000 or the actual cost, whichever is less, to cover the expenses associated with the funeral and religious ceremonies of Scheduled Tribe families.

Could you provide insights into the special case scenario mentioned in the scheme?

Certainly. In cases where the applicant is not from a Scheduled Tribe family but the deceased individual is, the applicant can still claim assistance under the scheme. However, to be eligible, the applicant must establish a direct relationship with the deceased person. This claim should be made within 12 months from the occurrence of the death within the kin's family.

Who is eligible to apply for the benefits of the "Antya Sanskar Sahay Yojana"?

The scheme is open to Scheduled Tribe families. The eligibility criteria specify that either the deceased individual or the applicant seeking assistance must belong to a Scheduled Tribe family. Additionally, the family's annual income should not exceed ₹ 3,00,000.

What is the primary objective of the "Antya Sanskar Sahay Yojana" launched by the Department of Tribal Welfare in Goa?

The main objective of the "Antya Sanskar Sahay Yojana" is to provide financial support to Scheduled Tribe families in covering the expenses associated with the funeral and religious ceremonies of deceased family members.

How does the scheme address cases where the applicant seeking assistance is not from a Scheduled Tribe family, but the deceased person is?

In such scenarios, the applicant can still apply for assistance, provided they establish a direct relationship with the deceased. This ensures that eligible individuals, even if not from a Scheduled Tribe background, can access the benefits if they can prove their relationship with the deceased.

What are the documents required to prove the annual income eligibility criterion?

To establish that the annual family income does not exceed ₹ 3,00,000, applicants need to submit an Income Certificate issued by the Competent Authority. This certificate verifies their income status and ensures compliance with the scheme's income threshold.

How does the scheme determine the actual cost of funeral and religious ceremonies?

The scheme allows financial assistance of up to ₹ 20,000 or the actual cost, whichever is less. The "Vouchers Receipts" document is significant here, as it serves as a record of expenses incurred during the ceremonies, enabling accurate calculation of assistance based on actual costs.

Can you provide insights into the "Sanctioning Authority" and the decision-making process within the scheme?

The Director of Tribal Welfare scrutinizes the applications in the prescribed manner. Approved applications are then sanctioned by the Directorate of Tribal Welfare, and the sanctioned benefits are electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Any difficulties in implementation are resolved by a state-level committee, ensuring transparency and fair decision-making.

Can you explain the significance of the "Mandate Form" among the required documents?

The "Mandate Form" is essential as it provides the necessary authorization for the financial assistance to be transferred to the beneficiary's bank account. This ensures a seamless and secure transfer process, allowing beneficiaries to receive the sanctioned amount promptly.
