> **Procedure for calculation & fixation of Monetary Limits of Micro & Small Enterprises:**

The monetary limit of the company is fixed based on the unit's net sales turnover during the last three years reflected in the Audited Balance Sheets. The monetary limit will be fixed based on the highest turnover during the last three years which may or may not be of last year provided the units installed and operating capacity has not been reduced.

• In case there is no decrease in plant and machinery, then 50% of the highest turnover during the last 3 years reflected in the audited balance sheet will be the basis for the fixation of monetary limit.

• In case there is a decrease in plant and machinery of more than 10%, the following will be considered:

1.  Where the turnover of the Enterprise has steadily increased over the last three years and the unit is in profit continuously, the Monetary Limit may be fixed at 50% of net sales turnover achieved in the last year.
2.  In case the Company/Partnership concern/Proprietorship unit is in loss for one year out of the past three years, their monetary limit will be fixed at 40% of their average net sales turnover.
3.  Similarly, when the Micro & Small Enterprise has been in loss for two years out of the past three years, the monetary limit will be accordingly fixed at 30% of their average net sales turnover of the past three years.
4.  In the event of Micro & Small Enterprise being in loss throughout the past three years, the monetary limit of the Unit will be fixed at 20% of the average net sales turnover of the Unit during the past three years.
