Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBARdhan)
=======================================================

Agriculture

Renewable Energy

Solid Waste Management

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/gobardhan#details)

Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBARdhan) was launched by the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation in April 2018 as a part of the Solid and Liquid Waste Management component under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) to positively impact village cleanliness and generate wealth and energy from cattle and organic waste. The main focus of GOBARDHAN is to keep villages clean, increase the income of rural households, and generate energy and organic manure from cattle waste. As rural India has already attained the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, the importance of GOBARDHAN has increased as it supports the villages in achieving ODF-plus status, which is an important objective of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase II.

﻿

GOBARDHAN: Waste to Wealth program has been designed to provide a common platform for schemes of different Ministries/Departments such as the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE); Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG); Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD); Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DACFW); Department of Rural Development; and Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS). DDWS is the coordinating Department for the implementation of the scheme.
