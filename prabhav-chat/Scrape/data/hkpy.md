**The following aims and objectives will also be achieved:-**

*   To augment the income of the rural people where poultry farming along with livestock rearing is being carried on as a mixed farming complementary to crop production.
*   Doubling of income of farmers.
*   To increase the employment opportunities for the rural population since most of them are unemployed or grossly underemployed.
*   To produce manure of high grade at a minimal cost.
