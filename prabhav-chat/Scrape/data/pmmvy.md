[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmmvy#faqs)

By When Can I Claim The Second Installment Of The Cash Incentive?

The 2nd installment can be claimed 180 days after the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) of the applicant.

Does this scheme provides any additional coverages?

Apart from the three installments to be claimed within 150 days, 180 days, and at childbirth, the scheme does not offer additional coverages.

Does the benefit under PMMVY continue in case of death?

No, in an unfortunate event that the child does not survive, the beneficiary is not eligible for benefits under PMMVY for further pregnancies as she has already claimed the installments.

Will the beneficiary get the benefit in case of miscarriage or stillbirth?

The beneficiary will receive the installments until the pregnancy is active. Since the benefit is paid out in three installments depending upon the pregnancy milestones, the beneficiary will receive at least two installments in case of stillbirth. The date of miscarriage will be a factor in deciding whether the benefit will continue or not.

I have received only the first installment under an old “Maternity Benefit Program (MBP) called Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY). Can I claim the remaining installments under the PMMVY?

Beneficiaries who have received only the first installment under the old MBP (IGMSY) scheme can claim only third installment under the PMMVY scheme, subject to meeting the criteria of PMMVY.
