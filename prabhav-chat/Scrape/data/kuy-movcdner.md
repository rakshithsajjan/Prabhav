**About**

Realizing the potential of organic farming in the North Eastern Region of the country Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare has launched a Central Sector Scheme entitled “Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region" for implementation in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, during the 12th plan period. The scheme aims at development of certified organic production in a value chain mode to link growers with consumers and to support the development of entire value chain starting from inputs, seeds, and certification, to the creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing marketing and brand building initiative.

﻿

**Mission Objectives**

A. To develop crop commodity-specific organic value chain and address gaps in organic crop production, wild crop harvesting, organic livestock management and processing handling and marketing of organic agricultural products through:

1.  Developing crop-specific organic production clusters with necessary infrastructural, technical and financial support.
2.  By facilitating partnerships between farmers and organic businesses: Local enterprises and/or Farmer Producer Companies based on back-to-back long-term trade relations with clients in domestic and export markets.
3.  By providing enabling environment for project initiatives and development programs with the necessary support for organic value chain development and creating market access.

﻿

B. To empower producers with program ownership by organizing them into Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) with the final aim to federate into farmer-producer organizations/ companies.

C. To replace conventional farming/subsistence farming system into local resource-based, self sustainable, high value commercial organic enterprise.

D. Developing commodity-specific commercial organic value chain under an integrated and concentrated approach with end-to-end facilities for production, processing, storage and marketing.

E. Development of organic parks/zones with facilities for collection, aggregation, value addition, processing, storage and market-linkages for specific commodities requiring capital-intensive technology.

F. Develop NER products as brands/labels through brand building and facilitating stronger marketing access under the ownership of growers’ organizations/ companies.

G. Creating state specific lead agency (Organic Commodity Board or Organic Mission) for coordinating, monitoring, supporting and financing the development and operationalization of the entire value chain.

﻿

**Project Strategies**

1.  To mobilize commodity clusters and facilitate capacity building, hand holding, and infrastructure creation for on-farm input production, training on the package of practices and facilitating certification services to farmers.
2.  To facilitate the creation and linking of enterprises (local enterprises/ farmer producer companies) that can create and operate collection, aggregation and post-harvest processes, trade organic products and provide necessary services to farmers and work towards increasing their market.
3.  To set up lead agencies at central and state to partner with value chain supporting agencies, and service providers and institute business development consultancies. To provide access to information, know-how and finance and enable the enterprises to offer efficient services, support them in building required management capacities, and stimulate market growth.

﻿

**Mission Implementation Structure**

The scheme “Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region” will be implemented in a Mission mode. The Mission structure at the Government of India level will comprise of National Advisory Committee (NAC), Executive Committee (EC), Mission Monitoring Committee (MMC) and Mission Head Quarter at DAC&FW.

﻿

The State Lead Agency shall function under the overall supervision of the Department of Agriculture/ Horticulture and State Lead Agency shall be manned by professional experts on contract.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/kuy-movcdner#benefits)

**Developing crop specific organic production cluster**

1.  **Clusters development and formation of Farmer Producer Organizations/ Companies** Crop/commodity-specific production clusters will be developed in a concentrated mode for ease in training, hand holding, certification and collection and aggregation. Farmers can be grouped into Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) at the village level and federated into organizations/ companies at District/ state level in accordance with Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) guidelines for the formation of farmer Producer Companies. States can hire the services of competent resource agencies preferably experienced in Farmer Producer Company (FPCs) making, organic farming and having experience in value chain developments, cluster development and formation of FPCs.

*   In States where FPCs have already been created additional clusters should be developed adjacent to the existing MOVCDNER clusters under the existing FPC. Efforts should be made to create commodity-specific clusters, where a minimum of 50-60% area is cropped with targeted commodities. New FPC may be made only when the clusters are developed in new areas where there are no FPCs. Even existing FPC in that area may be approached to include FIGs under the scheme. This will help in saving the expenditure for the creation of a new FPC.

3.  **Assistance for on-farm input production unit and off-farm inputs** Registered farmers of FIGs/FPCs will be assisted with the creation of on-farm input production infrastructure such as liquid manure tanks, NADEP compost tanks, botanical extracts etc. The assistance will be available up to a maximum of 2 ha per beneficiary. One-time assistance of Rs. 3750 per ha (up to a maximum of Rs. 7500/- for 2 ha per beneficiary) will be provided as a direct benefit transfer on verification of infrastructure created. The funds for component A.1.2. are being given in three year , and may be availed in the first year if needed, under intimation to GoI.
4.  **Off-farm inputs such as biofertilizers, bio-pesticides and neem cake etc** One time assistance of Rs. 3750 per ha area will be provided to the farmers registered under the program in the first year for procurement of bio fertilizers, bio pesticides and neem cake etc. Maximum assistance per beneficiary will be restricted to 2 ha (up to Rs 7500 per beneficiary). Assistance shall be provided as direct benefit transfer on verification of input purchases.
5.  **Assistance for quality seed and planting material** To ensure quality and varietal uniformity registered farmers will be provided with quality seed/ planting material.

The funds for the component A.1.3. are being given in three years, and may be availed in the first year, if needed, under intimation to GoI.

﻿

**Support for extension services, input facilitation, training hand holding and certification at the production stage**

1.  **Assistance for setting up of input delivery, distribution centers, and agri-machinery custom hiring center** To facilitate lead agencies for the creation of input facilitation service center and agri- machinery custom hiring center at commodity cluster / FPC level a sum of Rs. 10.00 lakh/FPC have been provided for the creation of need-based facilities depending upon the crop and activities being undertaken.
