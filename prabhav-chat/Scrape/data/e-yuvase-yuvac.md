[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/e-yuvase-yuvac#details)

“Empowering Youth for Undertaking Value Added Innovative Translational Research (E-YUVA)” scheme was started by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) to promote a culture of applied research and need-oriented (societal or industry) entrepreneurial innovation among young students and researchers. The scheme provides funding support (through fellowship and research grant), technical and business mentoring, exposure to bio incubation model, orientation to an entrepreneurial culture, etc. to students at various levels including undergraduates, post-graduates, and post-doctoral.

> **E-YUVA Centers (EYCs):**

The BIRAC’s E-YUVA scheme is implemented through dedicated hubs called “E-YUVA Centers (EYCs)” housed within the University/Institute set up and mentored by a BIRAC BioNEST-supported bio-incubator. EYCs act as anchors and extend requisite support and mentoring to students. Each EYC has a BIRAC-supported pre-incubation space which offers infrastructure and equipment for basic research and experimentation by selected students. Advanced research needs are fulfilled through Bio-incubator Connect.

**BIRAC-supported EYCs encompass the following:**

*   Pre-incubation space (3,000 sq. ft. or more)
*   Manage Fellowships for students
*   Conduct Entrepreneurial Awareness Workshops for students

**Roles and Responsibilities of EYCs:**

*   View and process online applications received for fellowship
*   Screen applications for eligibility and suitability for the scheme
*   Carry out online Technical Review of eligible applications through Subject Experts (Reviewers)
*   Shortlist proposals for interview(F2F/skype/telephonic) by an Expert Panel
*   Communicate decision to applicants at each step of selection
*   Seek BIRAC approval on the final selection of fellows or their eligibility
*   Issue fellowship award letters to the selected candidates on behalf of BIRAC
*   Release fellowship and research grant received from BIRAC
*   Provide mentorship, handholding, and access to facilities at EYC and EYC Knowledge Partner for BIRAC’s Innovation and E-YUVA Fellows
*   Monitor the targeted milestones
*   Organize periodic review meetings
*   Provide mentorship and handholding for domain expertise, entrepreneurship, and activities including but not limited to IP management, mobilizing resources, and other business development-related activities
*   Provide platforms/opportunities for interaction with experts.
*   Provide periodic updates and reports on the progress of Fellows to BIRAC
*   Conduct entrepreneurial workshops
*   Any other activity required for effective implementation of fellowships on mutual consent with BIRAC.

> **Tenure of EY Centres:**

EYCs will be engaged for an initial duration of 3 years, extendable further based on performance review. The performance of the EYCs would be evaluated annually.

> **E-Yuva Knowledge Partner:**

For the mentoring of Innovation Fellows and for providing overall guidance to EYCs, BIRAC will assign engagement with BioNEST-supported Bio-incubators. Each EYC will be formally associated with a BioNEST-supported bio incubator, which shall provide necessary handholding and mentoring to EYCs and Innovation Fellows. The knowledge partner will engage with the fellows throughout the award period and provide overall guidance. Bio-incubators will act as brand ambassadors for the program and will help in its outreach.
