2.  Promotion and ensure voluntary ownership among local community by way of contribution in cash, kind and/ or labour and voluntary labour (shramdaan)
3.  Assistance in ensuring sustainability of water supply system, i.e. water source, water supply infrastructure, and funds for regular O&M
4.  Empowering and development of human resource in the sector such that the demands of construction, plumbing, electrical, water quality management, water treatment, catchment protection, O&M, etc. are taken care of in short and long term
5.  Awareness on various aspects and significance of safe drinking water and involvement of stakeholders in manner that make water everyone's busine

﻿

The applicant need not apply for the scheme.

﻿

State Governments/ UT Administration will implement the mission based on the finalized SAP with timelines to cover all the villages of the respective State/ UT. Each village will be assessed on existing water supply infrastructure by DWSM in consultation with Gram Panchayat and/ or its sub-committee and ISA. Based on the same, FHTCs will be provided to every rural household by creating in-village water supply infrastructure including source development under any one of the following suggested categories, viz.

1.  Retrofitting of ongoing schemes taken up under erstwhile NRDWP for the last mile connectivity;
2.  Retrofitting of completed rural water supply schemes to make it JJM compliant;
3.  Single Village Scheme (SVS) in villages having adequate groundwater/ spring water/ local or surface water source of prescribed quality;
4.  Single Village Scheme (SVS) in villages having adequate groundwater that needs treatment;
5.  Multi Village Scheme (MVS) with water grids/ regional water supply scheme; and
6.  Mini solar power-based piped water supply in isolated/ tribal hamlets.

﻿

[### Documents Required](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/jjm#documents-required)

Any proof of identity like Voter ID / Passport / Driving License / Ration Card / Aadhaar Card etc. is sufficient to apply for water connection

﻿

[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/jjm#faqs)

How water will be provided to households where tap water connections are not feasible?

In such areas, local innovations/ technological solutions will be explored. Suggestive technological solutions to address challenges in the supply of drinking water are as under: Solar energy based stand-alone water supply systems for scattered/ isolated/ tribal/ hilly villages. Community Water Purification Plant (CWPP) in groundwater contaminated areas. In cold deserts, solutions may be explored to enhance and store run-off water in small tanks - traditional water harvesting structure, i.e. Zings of Ladakh. Further, artificial glacial reservoirs may be created by diverting the run-off to freeze & store as glacier. In hard rock areas, bore-blast technique, fracture seal cementation, stream blasting, etc. may be explored. In hilly areas, adopting spring-based sources, rain water harvesting and standalone bore-well systems (if feasible) will be explored. In coastal areas, energy efficient small desalination plants with high recovery ratio will be explored, along with construction of sub-surface dykes in rivers. Use of Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS) software, etc., will be required for planning and monitoring.
