**1\. Address Challenges in the MSME Sector:** The RAMP program will address the generic and Covid related challenges in the MSME sector by way of impact enhancement of existing MSME schemes, especially, on the competitiveness front.

**2\. Address inadequately Addressed Blocks in MSME:** The program will bolster the inadequately addressed blocks of capacity building, handholding, skill development, quality enrichment, technological upgradation, digitization, outreach, and marketing promotion, amongst other things.

**3\. Generate Employment:** RAMP program, through enhanced collaboration with States, will be a job-enabler, market promoter, and finance facilitator, and will support vulnerable sections and greening initiatives.

**4\. Usher in Larger Formalization:** In States where the presence of MSMEs is on the lower side, the program will usher in larger formalization resulting from the higher impact of the schemes covered under RAMP. The SIPs developed by these States would act as a roadmap for the development of an improved MSME sector.

**5\. Complement the Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission:** RAMP will complement the AtmanNirbhar Bharat mission by fostering innovation and enhancement in industry standards, and practices and providing the necessary technological inputs to the MSMEs.
