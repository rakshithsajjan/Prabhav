[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ignwpstn#faqs)

Is the pension amount credited directly to my bank account, or can I receive it another way?

The pension is typically deposited directly into your bank account. You'll provide your bank details during the application process. However, you can inquire with the CSC staff about the possibility of receiving the pension in cash at designated centers, subject to availability and approval.

Can I use the free rice benefit even if I am not taking nutritious meals at the Anganwadi center?

Yes, you are still eligible to receive 2kg of free rice per month from the Anganwadi center, regardless of whether you participate in their meal program.

What is the quality of the free saree distributed under the scheme?

The sarees are procured by the government and adhere to basic quality standards for fabric and wearability. However, the specific design and quality might vary depending on budget allocations and availability.

Can I sell or exchange the free saree for cash or other goods?

No, the free saree is meant for your personal use and cannot be sold or exchanged for any form of financial gain. Doing so might be considered a violation of the scheme's guidelines.

What happens if the free saree is damaged or lost after receiving it?

Unfortunately, the scheme doesn't provide replacements for damaged or lost sarees.

Can I choose a specific collection date for the free rice?

No, the Anganwadi centers typically have designated distribution days and timings. You can inquire about the schedule at your nearest center.

Is there a limit on how long I can receive the benefits under this scheme?

No, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria and remain a widow, you can continue receiving the pension, free saree, and rice throughout the scheme.

What happens if I remarry? Will I still be eligible for the benefits?

No, remarrying would disqualify you from continuing to receive the benefits under the scheme. The scheme is specifically designed to support widows facing financial hardship.

I am a differently-abled widow. Are there any additional benefits or support available?

You might be eligible for additional support based on your specific needs and the availability of government programs. It's recommended to consult with the Social Welfare Department to explore other schemes or benefits that cater to differently-abled individuals.

I am physically unable to collect the free rice from the Anganwadi center. Can someone else collect it on my behalf?

Yes, you can authorize a family member or trusted individual to collect the rice on your behalf. You might need to complete an authorization form provided by the Anganwadi center.

Can I choose the color or design of the free saree?

No, the scheme typically provides pre-selected colors and designs for the free sarees distributed during Pongal and Deepavali.

I live in a remote area. Are there mobile camps or alternative ways to apply besides visiting the CSC?

You can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.
