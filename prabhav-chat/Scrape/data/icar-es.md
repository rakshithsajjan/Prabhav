[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/icar-es#details)

The ICAR Emeritus Scientist Scheme is a structural method of tapping the Brain and skill bank of the outstanding superannuated professionals of NARS by allowing them to complete the work in hand for its fruitful conclusion, utilize their talent in teaching specialized courses and use their experience in addressing nationally important policy issues.

Retired scientists may often be in a position to work and teach in economically and ecologically underprivileged regions. Hence their expertise should also be mobilized for launching a movement in science for remedying regional imbalances in agricultural development.

The Emeritus Scientist scheme aims at:

• To Utilise the services of outstanding superannuated scientists from NARS by allowing them to complete the nationally important research already underway and also for initiating a new programme in nationally important priority areas.

• To Use the talent of outstanding retired teachers in teaching specialized courses and developing instructional material, especially multimedia for use in national agricultural education programmes including distance education.

The benefit of the scheme shall be open only to the scientists of repute of the level of Principal Scientist/Professor and above from the National Agriculture Research System that includes State Agricultural Universities, Deemed Universities, Central Agricultural Universities, Central Universities having agriculture facilities, Centre and State funded institutions/organizations engaged in Agricultural Research, Education, Human Resource Development and Extension.
