*   A capacity that usually does not go over 100 to 200; therefore, such a space is often called a “little theatre” or “intimate theatre” because it allows for close-up and intimate viewing by spectators.
*   One or two adjoining green room(s)/dressing room(s) /makeup room(s) with toilet(s) for the performers, and a storage area; therefore, the entire unit, though minimal, functions as a theatre in every sense.
