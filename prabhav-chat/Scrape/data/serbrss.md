SERB Research Scientist Scheme
==============================

Faculty

Research Scientist

SERB

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serbrss#details)

The INSPIRE Faculty Scheme of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Ramanujan Fellowship Scheme of the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) offer opportunities for young scientists to initiate and sustain research careers in various fields of science and engineering. These schemes do not offer an extension of the fellowship after the completion of five years. The support link is broken after the end of the tenure of the respective fellowships.

In order to provide a platform for the sustainment of their research for some more time, the SERB Board has recently approved a new ‘SERB Research Scientist (SRS) Scheme’ for the awardees of INSPIRE Faculty and Ramanujan Fellowships, who fail to secure regular positions after completion of the regular tenure of five years in the respective schemes. The fellows will be called ‘SERB Research Scientists’. The scheme provides an opportunity for them to continue their research activities and also to explore regular positions during the intervening period.

> **Objective:**

Identify and provide a platform for sustainment of the research career of INSPIRE Faculty and Ramanujan Fellows for an additional period of two years after completion of the regular tenure of five years in the respective schemes.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serbrss#benefits)

The “SERB Research Scientists” will be entitled to receive the grants as given below:
