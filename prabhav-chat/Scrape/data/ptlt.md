Plastic Tunnel

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ptlt#details)

The Agriculture Department of the Rajasthan government implemented the Plastic Tunnel (Lo-Tunnel) scheme, providing subsidies to farmers. A low plastic tunnel is a protected structure created by covering each crop bed with plastic sheeting at a low height after planting. It is made to protect crops from damage caused by low temperatures. This technique is very useful for off-season cultivation of vegetables in the plains of North India where the night temperature remains below 8 degrees Celsius for about 40 to 60 days during the winter season. This technique allows off-season vegetable cultivation. Vegetable seedlings are prepared using the plastic tray technique specifically in December and January.
