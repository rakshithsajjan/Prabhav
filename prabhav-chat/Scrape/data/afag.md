Amar Fasal Amar Gola
====================

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/afag#details)

The West Bengal Government had announced a pilot project to provide financial assistance to marginal farmers of the State so that they can have their own storehouses and vending carts. A subsidy varying between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 25,000 will be provided for the warehouses. Though there are 24 lakh small and marginal farmers in the State, only around 10,000 such farmers would be covered initially under two schemes. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has named the schemes as Amar Fasal, Amar Gola (My Crop, My Storehouse) and Amar Fasal Amar Gari (My crop, my vehicle). In the case of the AmarFasal Amar Gari project, the rate of subsidy would be Rs. 10,000 flat. This project will facilitate those farmers who wish to directly sell their products to end users. The subsidies would be directly credited to the bank accounts of those farmers who own Kisan Credit Cards.
