Can I apply for the scheme online without visiting the CSC?

Currently, applying for the scheme requires visiting the nearest Common Service Center (CSC). They will assist you with the application process, including biometric verification and document upload.

I don't have access to a computer or the internet at home. How can I apply?

You can still apply by visiting the nearest CSC. They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf.

What happens if I cannot attend the distribution event for the free clothes?

In most cases, the sarees and dhotis can be collected later from designated distribution centers. However, it's best to check with the CSC or local authorities for specific details and collection timelines.

Do I need to show proof of being destitute during the application process?

Yes, you might need to submit documents like income certificates, ration card, or self-declaration stating your financial situation to demonstrate your eligibility.

Do I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the benefits?

No, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.

I live in a remote area. Are there mobile camps or alternative ways to apply besides visiting the CSC?

You can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.

I recently turned 60 and am unsure about the application process. Can someone help me?
