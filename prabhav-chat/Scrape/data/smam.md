[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/smam#details)

Agricultural machines take an important role to increase productivity with timely and precise fieldwork. To promote the usage of farm mechanization and increase the ratio of farm power to cultivable unit area up to 2.5 kW/ha, the scheme will be implemented in all the Indian states

The SMAM scheme has both centrally sponsored and central sector scheme components. In the centrally sponsored scheme components, the Government of India funds 60% of the cost and the states’ share is 40% in all states except north-eastern and Himalayan states where the ratio is 90:10 wherein GOI funds 90%. In UTs, the central share is 100%.

1.  Conduct performance testing for various farm machineries and equipment at the four Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institutes (FMTTIs), designated State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and ICAR institutions.
2.  Promote farm mechanization among stakeholders by way of on-field and off-field training and demonstrations.
3.  Provide financial assistance to farmers for procurement of farm machinery and implements.
