2.  Increase the amenity value of cities by developing greenery and well maintained open spaces (e.g. parks) and
3.  Reduce pollution by switching to public transport or constructing facilities for non-motorized transport (e.g. walking and cycling).

All these outcomes are valued by citizens, particularly women, and indicators and standards have been prescribed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA ) in the form of Service Level Benchmarks (SLBs).

[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/amrut#eligibility)

This is an open scheme and there is no eligibility required for the scheme.

Five hundred cities have been selected under AMRUT.

[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/amrut#application-process)

The applicant need not apply for the scheme.

Projects will be executed by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

In case the ULBs do not have adequate capacity to handle projects, the State Government may recommend in State Annual Action Plan (SAAP), upon a Resolution passed by the ULB, for the execution of the projects by specialized parastatal agencies of the State or Central Governments. Such arrangements should necessarily be executed by way of a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) amongst the State Government, the specialized Parastatal agencies and the concerned Municipality.

In such a case, the capacity of the ULBs will be augmented through the capacity-building component of the AMRUT. The maintenance and upkeep of the created assets will be the responsibility of the ULB and the State Government.

[### Documents Required](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/amrut#documents-required)

There are no documents required for the scheme.

You can check the list of cities here. http://amrut.gov.in/content/citiescovered\_map.php

Can the ULB hire consultant for the SLIP preparation?

The MoHUA has simplified the process for SLIP preparation and is also hand -holding the cities. It is for States/ ULBs to decide on hiring the services of a consultant.

2\. Is there any limit to the project cost for each sector that the ULBs will propose for SLIP?

No, but the states/ ULBs has to give consideration to the National Priorities of the Mission and the Guidelines. It is universal coverage water and sewerage (Para 5.1, 6.5 and 6.6).

How ULB Will Share 30% In AMRUT? It Is Very Difficult Of ULBs Which Are Depended On States.

The contribution of State Govt is minimum 20%. There is no upper limit on State share in SAAP. The States / ULBs may decide in accordance with para 7.4 and 7.5 of guidelines.

What shall be the general order of prioritization of projects in water and sewerage sector?

Universal coverage of water supply shall be given top priority. Next will be universal coverage of sewerage connection to all households.
