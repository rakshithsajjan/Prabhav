[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/igndpstn#faqs)

I am a person with a disability, but the percentage is 75%. Am I eligible for the scheme?

Unfortunately, no. The scheme requires a minimum disability of 80% or above to be eligible for the pension and other benefits.

I am a senior citizen with a disability, but my income is slightly above the BPL limit. Can I still apply?

No, exceeding the Below Poverty Line (BPL) limit automatically disqualifies you from the scheme. You can explore other government programs or disability-specific support initiatives that might cater to your situation.

I have a child with a disability. Can they apply for the scheme?

Yes, as long as the child is 18 years old or above and meets the other eligibility criteria (80% or above disability and BPL category), they can apply for the scheme independently.

Can I apply for the scheme online without visiting the CSC?

Currently, no. Applying for the scheme requires visiting the nearest Common Service Center (CSC). They will assist you with the application process, including biometric verification and document upload.

I live in a rural area with limited internet access. How can I apply?

You can still apply by visiting the nearest CSC. They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf, even if you don't have internet access at home.

What happens if I cannot attend the distribution event for the free clothes?

In most cases, the sarees and dhotis can be collected later from designated distribution centers. However, it's best to check with the CSC or local authorities for specific details and collection timelines.

Do I need a medical certificate proving my disability during the application process?

Yes, you will need to submit a Differently Abled ID card as proof of your disability and the percentage of impairment.

Do I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the benefits?

No, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.

I am a person with a visual impairment. How can I navigate the application process at the CSC?

The CSC staff is trained to assist individuals with disabilities. You can inform them about your visual impairment, and they can guide you through the process or even help you fill out the application form.

I am concerned about the privacy of my disability information during the application process.

The application process adheres to strict data privacy regulations. Your information is used solely for the purpose of assessing your eligibility for the scheme.

Can I choose the color or design of the free dhoti or saree?

No, the scheme typically provides pre-selected colors and designs for the free clothes distributed during Pongal and Deepavali.

I am unable to collect the free rice due to my disability. Can someone else collect it on my behalf?

Yes, you can authorize a family member or trusted individual to collect the rice on your behalf. You might need to complete an authorization form provided by the Anganwadi center.
