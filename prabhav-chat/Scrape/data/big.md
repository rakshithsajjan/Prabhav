> **Selection process:**

BIG selection is a multi-tier process involving the following steps:

**Step 01:** Eligibility Check: BIG Partners screen the applications for eligibility requirements as laid out in the scheme document and appropriateness under the BIG scheme.

**Step 02:** Examination by Preliminary Selection Committee (PSC): The PSC examines all eligible proposals on the following contours:

• Scheme fit

• Availability of adequate technical details which are minimally required for online review

• Plagiarism

**Step 03:** Online review by subject matter experts: Proposals recommended by PSC are reviewed online by 3 or more subject matter experts.

**Step 04:** Presentation before Thematic Technical Expert Panel (TEP): Based on expert reviews, shortlisted applications are called for a Face-to-face presentation before the Technical Expert Panel (TEP). The TEPs are conducted in a thematic manner where all proposals of a particular theme are evaluated together by a common committee. All proposals are scored by individual TEP Experts and the Geometric Mean of Individual Scores is used to arrive at the final score for a particular proposal.

• Proposals with score ≥60 are considered at the next step (ESC)

• Proposals with score <60 are not considered further

**Step 05:** Scoring Cut-off decision by the Expert Selection Committee (ESC): ESC takes the final decision with regard to the cut-off score for final selection. Proposals above the decided cut-off will be considered for further due diligence. ESC may choose to have either the same or differential scoring cut off across the themes.

**Step 06:** ESC-recommended applications are then subjected to final financial and technical due diligence by the BIG Partner. This may require a visit by BIG partner representative(s) to the applicant’s site and involves the following steps:

• Reconfirming eligibility by verification of original documents

• Legal, technical, and financial due diligence

• Confirming applicant’s claimed resources: Space, equipment, manpower, advisors, incubation services, samples, etc.

• Confirming compliance strategy with regard to safety, ethics, waste disposal, etc.

• Confirming for any special guidance by ESC

• Justification of budget (usually by verifying quotations); meeting budget caps and other requirements

• Finalization of milestones, budget, and payment schedule; defining clear measurable milestones.

> **Indicative evaluation criteria:** BIG Proposals are reviewed on the following parameters during online review and TEP Stage:

1\. Unmet Need (max 20)

2\. Value Proposition/Differentiation (max 20)

3\. Technical Viability (max 30)

4\. Team Strength/Passion (max 15)
