The scheme facilitates a working capital collateral-free loan of \u20b910,000, with subsequent loans of \u20b920,000 and \u20b950,000 with a 7% interest subsidy. The scheme focuses on increasing the digital footprint in India by promoting the use of digital transactions among street vendors. To incentivize the adoption of digital transactions, a cashback of up to \u20b9100 per month is given to Street Vendors.\n\n**Aim:**\n\nThe scheme aims to formalize the street vendors and open up new opportunities for this sector to move up the economic ladder.

Can they still be eligible?\n\nTo be eligible, the applicant should either be born in Goa or have their birth registered in Goa. Additionally, at least one of their parents should have been born in Goa.\n\nCan applicants who are not Indian citizens qualify for this pension?\n\nNo, the scheme specifies that the applicant should be a citizen of India, so non-Indian citizens are not eligible for this pension.\n\nIs there any flexibility regarding the 15-year residency requirement for widows?\n\nThere is no flexibility mentioned in the scheme regarding the 15-year residency requirement for widows. It appears to be a strict requirement.\n\nCan widows of deceased Seamen who were not residents of Goa qualify for this pension?\n\nNo, widows of deceased Seamen must have been residents of Goa for 15 years to be eligible for this pension.\n\nIs there a minimum number of years of sea service required for seamen invalidated from sea service on medical grounds before retirement to be eligible?\n\nUnlike other retired seamen, there is no specified minimum number of years of sea service required for seamen invalidated from sea service on medical grounds before retirement to be eligible.\n\nCan seamen who were invalidated from sea service on medical grounds before reaching the age of 60 still qualify for this pension?\n\nYes, seamen who were invalidated from sea service on medical grounds before retirement can qualify for this pension, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria.\n\nAre there any specific criteria that seamen need to meet to be considered \"retired\" for the purposes of this pension scheme?\n\nTo be considered \"retired\" for this pension scheme, seamen must have completed their service on board a ship and officially retired from that employment.\n\nWho has the final authority in decisions related to this scheme, and what is the role of the Commissioner?\n\nThe Commissioner for NRI Affairs appointed by the Government has the final authority in decisions related to this scheme. The Commissioner approves recommendations made by the sanctioning authority, and their decisions are final and binding.\n\nHow is the pension amount disbursed to beneficiaries, and what is the schedule for disbursement?\n\nThe pension amount is remitted directly into the savings bank account of the beneficiary on the last working day of every month.\n\nIs there a minimum period of service on board a ship that retired seamen need to fulfill to be eligible for this pension?\n\nRetired seamen should have rendered a total of 120 months (10 years) of actual service on board a ship. A break in service up to six months can be condoned while computing the total period of service. However, this limit does not apply to beneficiaries invalidated from sea service on medical grounds before retirement and widows of deceased beneficiaries on compassionate grounds.\n\nWhat are the residency requirements for applicants, and are there any exceptions to these requirements?\n\nApplicants should be bona fide residents of Goa by birth. If not, their birth should have been registered in Goa, or at least one of their parents should have been born in Goa.\n\nWhat does this scheme offer to its beneficiaries, and what is the amount of the pension provided?\n\nThis scheme provides a Gross Pension of \u20b92,500 per month to eligible beneficiaries.\n\nWhen did this scheme come into effect?\n\nThe \"Goa Welfare / Pension Scheme for Seafarers, 2021\" is a scheme established by the Home Department, Government of Goa. It came into effect on June 18, 2021, and was scheduled to remain in force until November 30, 2021.\n"}]}}

There is a growing demand for housing amongst families belonging to the low and middle-income categories. In order to cater to the housing needs of the Lower Income Group and the Middle Income Group, the Housing Department felt the need to make provisions for affordable housing, and decided to introduce a new Housing Scheme, namely \"NIJASHREE HOUSING SCHEME\".\n\nSalient Features of The Scheme:\n\n*   The scheme envisages the construction of dwelling units of a minimum of 16 flats in a block of G + 3 buildings on the government lands, lands of local bodies, and other parastatals.\n*   1BHK flats, with a minimum built-up area of 35.15 square meters (378 sq. ft.), will be constructed for the LIG category, and 2BHK flats, having a minimum built-up area of 50.96 square meters (559 sq. ft.), will be constructed for the MIG category.\n*   The unit cost will be determined on the basis of the actual cost of construction of the superstructure, substructure, and internal infrastructure including sanitary and plumbing, internal electrification, etc., incidental therein.\n*   No cost of land shall be taken into account while computing the unit cost. This freehold land will be treated as a subsidy to the beneficiary.\n*   The unit cost and standard built-up area may vary, depending on the location and quantum of the land available, as well as the land development cost and the schedule of rates applicable to the area, at the time of construction.\n*   Off-site infrastructure like the construction of internal roads, boundary wall, outside electrification, making of a drainage system, installation of lights in the campus and water supply shall not be added to the cost of the housing development scheme NIJASHREE, i.e., the purchaser will not have to pay for such infrastructure.\n*   Credit-linked subsidies to the eligible beneficiaries will be facilitated by the Housing Department, as per the existing scheme.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

The scheme is to provide maternity benefits to women belonging to socially and economically disadvantaged sections of society. The maternity benefit is to be provided to a woman for the first two living children provided the second child is a girl. For the first child the maternity benefit of \u20b95,000/- is provided in two instalments under PMMVY and the beneficiary is also entitled to receive the cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery so that on an average, a women gets \u20b96,000/-. For the second child, the benefit of \u20b96,000/- is to be provided subject to second child is a girl child, in one installment after the birth. Cases of miscarriage/still births are to be treated as fresh cases for providing maternity benefit under the scheme. Further, as per the new guidelines for '**Mission Shakti**\u2019, applicable with effect from 01.04.2022, the scheme **(PMMVY 2.0)** seeks to promote positive behavioral change towards girl child by providing additional cash incentive for the second child, if that is a girl child. Thus, for the second child, the benefit of \u20b96,000/- is to be provided in one instalment post birth. This would contribute towards improving Sex Ratio at Birth by discouraging female feticide. Also, in case of miscarriage/stillbirth, the beneficiary will be treated as a fresh beneficiary in the event of any future pregnancy.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmmvy#benefits)\n\nThe cash incentives is provided in two instalments for the first child as per the schedule provided in\n\ntable below:\n\n*   **Scheme Condition for First Child**\n\n<table class=\"border border-solid border-gray-300 w-full table-fixed border-collapse\"><tbody data-slate-node=\"element\"><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><strong><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Instalment</span></strong></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><strong><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Conditions</span></strong></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><strong><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Amount (in Rs.)</span></strong></span></span></td></tr><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><strong><span data-slate-string=\"true\">First Instalment</span></strong></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">On registration of pregnancy and at least one Antenatal checkup within six months from last menstrual period date at the Anganwadi Centre or approved Health facilities may be identified by the respective administering State/UT.</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">3,000/-</span></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<table class=\"border border-solid border-gray-300 w-full table-fixed border-collapse\"><tbody data-slate-node=\"element\"><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><strong><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Second Instalment</span></strong></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Childbirth is registered.

Since the benefit is paid out in three installments depending upon the pregnancy milestones, the beneficiary will receive at least two installments in case of stillbirth. The date of miscarriage will be a factor in deciding whether the benefit will continue or not.\n\nI have received only the first installment under an old \u201cMaternity Benefit Program (MBP) called Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY). Can I claim the remaining installments under the PMMVY?\n\nBeneficiaries who have received only the first installment under the old MBP (IGMSY) scheme can claim only third installment under the PMMVY scheme, subject to meeting the criteria of PMMVY.\n\nI Am Expecting Twins, Am I Also Eligible For This Scheme?\n\nYes, you are eligible to avail the benefits under this scheme.\n\nI Am Already Availing A Paid Maternity Leave From My Employer.

In border areas, the provision of essential infrastructure facilities and opportunities for sustainable living would help integrate these areas with the hinterland, create a positive perception of care by the country and encourage people to stay on in the border areas, leading to safe and secure borders.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe following basic principles will guide the implementation of the BADP:\n\na) Projects for developing infrastructure in strategically important villages/towns (as identified by Border Guarding Forces) will be given priority.\n\nb) Border Guarding Forces (BGFs) will be co-opted as part of the decision making process at all levels (Planning/ Execution / Monitoring).\n\nc) Keeping in view the limited availability of funds under BADS, the State/UT Level Screening Committee (SLSC/UTLSC) will ensure convergence with schemes of line Ministries and State/UT Governments and other available resources to ensure holistic development of the strategically important villages/ towns in the border areas.\n\nd) MHA will work in close collaboration with, inter-alia, M/o Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, M/o DoNER, M/o Health & Family Welfare, M/o Human Resource Development, M/o Jai Shakti, M/o New and Renewable Energy, M/o Power, M/o Rural Development, M/o Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, M/o MSME, M/o Women & Child Development, M/o Youth Affairs & Sports etc. to promote infrastructure development, improved connectivity, better social services and to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities in the border areas.\n\ne) Works/projects will be evaluated regularly through Social Audit mechanism, besides Prabhari Officers in addition to ongoing mechanisms of State/UT/ Central Governments.\n\nf) Saturation / coverage through ongoing developmental schemes of various Ministries of Government of India, if necessary, by relaxation of guidelines and yardsticks with the approval of the competent authority.\n\ng) Medium-Term perspective \u2014 Four/Five Year Perspective Action Plan would be prepared for development of identified habitations by pooling resources as mentioned in sub clause (c) above.

Presently, the Program covers 396 Blocks of 111 border Districts in 16 States and 2 Union Territories abutting the International Boundary viz. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir (UT), Ladakh (UT), Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Previously it has largely worked as a 'stand-alone' vehicle for project financing; it will now be converted to a programme which seeks comprehensive development.\n\nThe program will cover all the census villages/ towns, semi-urban and urban areas located within 0-10 Km distance (crow \u2014 fly/ aerial distance) from the first habitation from International Boundary (IB). The imaginary line joining all the first habitations from the IB will be the Zero line for BADP and the 10 km distance towards the interior will be calculated from this zero line. The State/UT Government will compile and provide a latest map of this border belt (0-10 Km) - district wise, depicting all the census villages, semi-urban/ urban areas with latest population statistics. The State/UT Government will furnish village/ town code (2011 Census) allotted by Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, Government of India, for mapping of the villages/ towns on the BADP Online Management System (BADP OMS).\n\nWithin this 0-10 km area, census villages, semi-urban and urban areas identified by BGFs as 'strategic villages/towns' shall be given highest priority. Once 0-10 km area is saturated, the program may cover 10-20/30/40/50 km area\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe funding is 90:10, 90% Central, 10% State respectively as of now.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/badp#application-process)\n\nOffline\n\n[### Documents Required](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/badp#documents-required)\n\nThe Central Government is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in this direction through special Central assistance for special area programs such as Hill Area Development Program (HADP) and Western Ghats Development Program (WGDP). Broadly speaking, development planning is of two types: the central planning and the indicative planning: the former is practiced in a centralized economy where the role of the state is dominant in the socio-economic life of the people.\n\n[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/badp#faqs)\n\nIs the scheme covering all the border districts of mentioned states?\n\nYes\n\nWhat is BADP OMS?\n\nSystem used for mapping of the villages/ towns through the BADP Online Management System.\n\nWho will review the implementation details of the scheme?\n\nThe Empowered Committee will review the implementation of all the individual/family/community benefit schemes of Government of India in the border areas.\n\nWhat will be the major benefits of the scheme?\n\nRoad development, Drinking water supply, Health infrastructures and so on.\n\nWhat are strategic villages/towns?\n\nWithin this 0-10 km area, census villages, semi-urban and urban areas identified by BGFs as 'strategic villages/towns.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/badp#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://meghalaya.gov.in/schemes/content/37481)\n\n[Guidelines](https://meghalaya.gov.in/dept/4)\n\n[Guidelines](https://megbad.gov.in/scheme_badp.html)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n![Image 13: twitter](https://cdn.myscheme.in/images/logos/twitter.svg)\n\n### Something went wrong.
