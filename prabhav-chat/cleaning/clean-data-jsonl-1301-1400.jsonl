Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.\n\n\ufeff\n\nBefore PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market.\n\n\ufeff\n\nTo infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.\n\n\ufeff\n\nPAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using \"Form 5\" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC\u2019s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSuch a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further.

On each of the OMC\u2019s transparency portals, a call out with the name \u2018Check DBTL (CTC) Status\u2019 has been provided. Consumers can click on this and see the status both for ATC as well as BTC methods.\n\nWhat Happens Where Transactions Sent To The Bank Fail And How Are They Dealt With?\n\nA) In case some transfers cannot be processed by the banks, they are termed as failures, and the failure cases if any along with the amount is received back from the Sponsor Bank by the OMCs. A report on such failure cases has been provided by the OMC on their portal which is accessible to the distributors as well as Call Centre. b) Payments returned will be re-processed twice in a span of 15 days each and if it is still not transferred, the amount will be kept for payment as and when the bank-related issues are resolved. c) If the amount towards the subsequent cylinder delivered is successfully transferred then the pending amount also will be transferred thereafter. d) The time period up to which such payments will be kept pending will be 3 months or the end of the current financial year whichever is later.\n\nHow Is The Quota Of Subsidized Cylinders Worked Out For New Consumers?\n\nA) The eligibility for the quota of subsidized cylinders for all new connections released is on a pro-rata basis. This is also applicable to CTC consumers. b) For new connections, CTC consumers will receive both the advance amount (after the booking of the first cylinder) and the subsidy amount (after the delivery of the first cylinder). c) Thereafter, they will receive a subsidy amount with every cylinder delivery upto the capped subsidized quota of cylinders.\n\nHow To Deal With Advance Amounts Given To Consumers When They Are On Transfer?\n\nA) CTC consumers, who are transferred, have to return the advance amount to the parent distributor.

Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.\n\n\ufeff\n\nBefore PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market.\n\n\ufeff\n\nTo infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.\n\n\ufeff\n\nPAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using \"Form 5\" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC\u2019s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSuch a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further. To confirm this they can either contact their LPG distributor or visit www.mylpg.in and access the individual OMC\u2019s portals. Such consumers will start getting the LPG subsidy directly into their bank account as soon as the scheme is launched in their district.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThose consumers who didn\u2019t join the scheme earlier but have their Aadhaar number with them can join the scheme and become CTC by getting the same seeded with their LPG distributor as well as with their banks. For those who are not yet enrolled with UIDAI and don\u2019t have an Aadhaar number can also join the scheme and become CTC by getting their bank details seeded into the LPG database.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Objectives -**\n\nThe following are the key objectives of the scheme -\n\na) Remove incentive for diversion.\n\nb) Protect entitlement and ensure subsidy to the consumer.\n\nc) Improve the availability/delivery of LPG cylinders for genuine users\n\nd) Weed out fake/duplicate connections\n\ne) Allow Self Selection in subsidy\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n![Image 14: twitter](https://cdn.myscheme.in/images/logos/twitter.svg)\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 15: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 16](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 17: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 18: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 23: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 24: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

You'll provide your bank details during the application process. However, you can inquire with the CSC staff about the possibility of receiving the pension in cash at designated centers, subject to availability and approval.\n\nCan I use the free rice benefit even if I am not taking nutritious meals at the Anganwadi center?\n\nYes, you are still eligible to receive 2kg of free rice per month from the Anganwadi center, regardless of whether you participate in their meal program.\n\nWhat is the quality of the free saree distributed under the scheme?\n\nThe sarees are procured by the government and adhere to basic quality standards for fabric and wearability. However, the specific design and quality might vary depending on budget allocations and availability.\n\nCan I sell or exchange the free saree for cash or other goods?\n\nNo, the free saree is meant for your personal use and cannot be sold or exchanged for any form of financial gain. Doing so might be considered a violation of the scheme's guidelines.\n\nWhat happens if the free saree is damaged or lost after receiving it?\n\nUnfortunately, the scheme doesn't provide replacements for damaged or lost sarees.\n\nCan I choose a specific collection date for the free rice?\n\nNo, the Anganwadi centers typically have designated distribution days and timings. You can inquire about the schedule at your nearest center.\n\nIs there a limit on how long I can receive the benefits under this scheme?\n\nNo, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria and remain a widow, you can continue receiving the pension, free saree, and rice throughout the scheme.\n\nWhat happens if I remarry?

The scheme is specifically designed to support widows facing financial hardship.\n\nI am a differently-abled widow. Are there any additional benefits or support available?\n\nYou might be eligible for additional support based on your specific needs and the availability of government programs. It's recommended to consult with the Social Welfare Department to explore other schemes or benefits that cater to differently-abled individuals.\n\nI am physically unable to collect the free rice from the Anganwadi center. Can someone else collect it on my behalf?\n\nYes, you can authorize a family member or trusted individual to collect the rice on your behalf. You might need to complete an authorization form provided by the Anganwadi center.\n\nCan I choose the color or design of the free saree?\n\nNo, the scheme typically provides pre-selected colors and designs for the free sarees distributed during Pongal and Deepavali.\n\nI live in a remote area. Are there mobile camps or alternative ways to apply besides visiting the CSC?\n\nYou can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ignwpstn#sources)\n\n[Citizen's Charter](https://cms.tn.gov.in/sites/default/files/documents/swwe_e_cc_2022_23.pdf)\n\n[Documents Required](https://tnlegalservices.tn.gov.in/swwe/Annexure_English.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

NSAP was launched on 15th August 1995.\n\nWhat Is The Objective Of NSAP?\n\nIn providing social assistance benefits to poor households in the case of old age, death of the breadwinner, and maternity, the NSAP aims at ensuring minimum national standards, in addition to the benefits that the States are currently providing or might provide in future. It also aims at ensuring that social protection to the beneficiaries everywhere in the country is uniformly available without interruption.\n\nWhat Are The Components Of NSAP?\n\nThe NSAP at its inception in 1995 had three components namely (1) National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS, (2) National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS), and (3) National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS). The National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS) was subsequently transferred on 1st April, 2001 from the Ministry of Rural development to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. On 1st April 2000 a new Scheme known as Annapurna Scheme was launched. This scheme aimed at providing food security to meet the requirement of those senior citizens who, though eligible, have remained uncovered under the NOAPS. In February 2009, two new Schemes known as Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS) and Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) were introduced. Presently NSAP comprises of five schemes, namely - (1) Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS), (2) Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS), (3) Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS), (4) National Family Benefit Scheme NFBS) and (5) Annapurna.\n\nWho Implements NSAP?\n\nThe NSAP is implemented in the States/UTs in accordance with the general conditions applicable to all components of the NSAP as well as specific conditions applicable to each component. The NSAP Schemes are mainly implemented by the Social Welfare Departments in the States. But NSAP is implemented by Rural Development Department in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Meghalaya and West Bengal; by the Department of Women & Child Development in Orissa and Puducherry; by the Revenue Department in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and by the Department of Labour Employment & Training in Jharkhand. The NSAP extends to both the rural as well as urban areas\n\nWhat Is The Basic Eligibility Criterion Under NSAP?\n\nFor getting benefits under NSAP the applicant must belong to a Below Poverty Line (BPL) family according to the criteria prescribed by the Govt. of India.\n\nHow Are The Beneficiaries Identified In Rural Areas?\n\nAs per the revised eligibility criteria, new beneficiaries will be identified from the BPL list prepared by the States/UTs as per guidelines issued by the Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) for the BPL Census 2002.\n\nHow Will The Identification Of The Beneficiaries Be Done In The Urban Areas?\n\nIdentification of eligible beneficiaries will be carried out as per the BPL list required to be prepared in connection with the poverty alleviation program off the ministry of Urban Housing and Poverty Alleviation.\n\nWhat Will Be The Position In Respect Of Existing Beneficiaries, Whose Names Are Not On The BPL List?\n\nThey will continue to get the pension as at present without any interruption notwithstanding the fact that their names are not borne on the BPL list, provided they were eligible as per the old criteria.\n\nWhat Is The Funding Pattern Envisaged Under NSAP?\n\nUnder NSAP 100 percent Central Assistance is extended to the States/UTs to provide the benefits in accordance with the norms, guidelines, and conditions laid down by the Central Government.\n\nWhat Is The Eligibility For Getting A Pension Under IGNOAPS?\n\nThe eligibility criteria under Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) is - The age of the applicant (male or female) should be 60 years or above. The applicant should belong to a household living below the poverty line according to the criteria prescribed by the Govt. of India\n\nHow Is IGNOAPS Different From The Earlier National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS)?\n\nUnder NOAPS, old age pensions were granted to a person who is 65 years old or higher and who is destitute in the sense of having little or no means of regular income. Pension under IGNOAPS is now granted to a person who is 60 years or above and belongs to a household below the poverty line instead of only to destitute.\n\nWhen Did The IGNOAPS Come Into Effect?\n\nThe National Old Age Pension Scheme has been renamed as Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOPS) and was formally launched on 19th November 2007.\n\nWhat Is The Pension Amount Under Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme? Whether Pension Is Restricted To Only One Person In A Family?\n\nThe central contribution of pension under the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) is Rs. 200/- per month per beneficiary up to 79 years and Rs.500/- per month per beneficiary from 80 year onwards and the State Governments may contribute over and above to this amount.
