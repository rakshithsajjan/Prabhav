The problems of unwed mothers are linked with various socio-economic and cultural variables. In Kerala, this problem is coupled with the ignorance and exploitation of the backward classes. It has been pointed out that there are many women in Wayanad and other districts of Kerala who are victims of social exploitation and atrocities and are often forced to become unmarried mothers. Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers.\n\nAs a part of this scheme, the Government is giving \u20b91000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back. Their place is taken up by someone else whom these women believe in. Therefore, their condition becomes pathetic and it becomes necessary to address their problems too.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/s-kerala#benefits)\n\n*   Under the scheme, financial assistance of \u20b91000/- per month will be given to unwed mothers.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/s-kerala#eligibility)\n\n1.

It enables migrant workers and their family members to access PDS benefits from any Fair Price Shop anywhere in the country, thus ensuring the food security through the inter-state portability of ration cards under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). A Fair Price Shop (FPS) is a public ration store licensed under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act of 1955. Ration card details and entitlements are available online on any ePoS device in the country. It includes both inter-State and intra-State (inter-district/intra-district) portability of ration cards.\n\nAssam is the 36th State to implement the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme. The ONORC plan has successfully been implemented in all 36 States/UTs making food security portable throughout the country. The government has launched a mobile app, namely \u2018**MERA RATION**\u2019 for acquiring the maximum benefit of the ONORC plan. The mobile app shall provide the user with real-time information. It is available in 13 languages. As per the official website of [**National Food Security Portal**](https://nfsa.gov.in/), there are more than 20 crores Ration Cards issued through more than 4.5 lakh POS enabled Fair Price Shops.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

One copy of the application for the scholarship in the prescribed form (a separate application form may be prescribed by the concerned State Government/UT for a 'fresh' and 'renewal' scholarship).\n2.  One copy of the passport-size photograph with signatures of the student thereon (for fresh scholarship)\n3.  One attested copy of each of the certificates/diplomas/degrees etc., with respect of all examinations passed\n4.  A certificate (in original) of income issued by an authorized Revenue Officer, not below the rank of Tehsildar.\n5.  A receipt in acknowledgement of the scholarship in the previous year on the form attached to the application only duly countersigned by the Head of the Institution concerned, if the applicant was in receipt of a scholarship under this Scheme in the preceding year.\n\n[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/csspostmsossi#faqs)\n\nHow does the scholarship program define the duration of awards, and how does this duration policy impact the recipients' education?\n\nThe scholarship is awarded from the stage at which it is given until the completion of the course. This policy provides consistent support throughout the recipient's academic journey, encouraging them to pursue their education with dedication.\n\nWhat is the rationale behind transitioning to Smart Cards for the disbursal of scholarship amounts, and how does this benefit both the authorities and beneficiaries?\n\nThe move to Smart Cards is aimed at ensuring efficient and secure disbursal of scholarship amounts. It reduces administrative complexities and ensures timely payments to beneficiaries while also offering them a more convenient and secure mode of receiving funds.\n\nCould you elaborate on the significance of providing financial support for thesis typing/printing charges to research scholars, and how this support aids in their academic pursuits?\n\nThe provision for thesis typing/printing charges assists research scholars in the final stages of their academic journey. It helps cover essential expenses related to the preparation of their research work, ensuring a smooth and successful completion.\n\nThe scholarship document mentions specific provisions regarding income calculation. Could you clarify how income is assessed when a student has one or both parents alive, and what happens if both parents have passed away?\n\nWhen either of the parents (or the husband in the case of married unemployed girl students) is alive, only their income should be considered, excluding the income of other family members, even if they are earning. However, when both parents (or the husband in the case of married but unemployed girl students) have passed away, the income of the guardian who is supporting the student in their studies should be considered. In cases where a student's parent's income is affected due to the death of one earning parent and falls within the income ceiling prescribed under the scheme, they become eligible for the scholarship, provided they meet other eligibility conditions. This applies from the month in which the parent's death occurred.\n\nCould you provide examples of situations where an applicant would be ineligible based on these exclusions?\n\nCertainly. Applicants would be ineligible if they are studying in the same stage of education in a different subject after passing one stage of education. Additionally, they would be ineligible if they have completed their educational career in one professional line, such as pursuing LLB after B.T/B. Ed. Furthermore, if they are studying in XI class of the Higher Secondary School courses or the XII class of the Multipurpose High School, they are ineligible, unless their tenth class examination is treated as equivalent to Matriculation, and they join other courses.\n\nI'd like to know more about the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries receiving coaching. What are the conditions that disqualify them from receiving a stipend?\n\nScholarship holders receiving coaching with financial assistance from the Central Government or State Government are not eligible for a stipend under the coaching schemes for the duration of the coaching program.\n\nI'm considering pursuing correspondence courses. How does the scholarship apply to students studying through correspondence courses, and what expenses are covered?\n\nIf you're pursuing studies through correspondence courses, you are eligible for reimbursement of non-refundable fees and an annual allowance of Rs. 900 for essential and prescribed books, as applicable.\n\nI noticed that students can accept free lodging, grants, or ad-hoc financial assistance from other sources in addition to the scholarship. Could you clarify the specific conditions for accepting these additional forms of support?\n\nStudents are allowed to accept free lodging or a grant, along with ad-hoc monetary assistance from the State Government or any other source, for the purchase of books, equipment, or meeting board and lodging expenses, in addition to the scholarship amount paid under the Scheme. There are no restrictions on accepting these forms of support in conjunction with the scholarship.\n\nCan scholarship recipients hold other scholarships or stipends concurrently, and if not, how do they choose between them?\n\nScholarship recipients cannot hold multiple scholarships or stipends simultaneously under this scheme. If they are awarded more than one scholarship or stipend, they must select the one that is more beneficial to them. The process for making this selection involves informing the awarding authority through the Head of the Institution. Once a scholarship is accepted, no further scholarships can be received.\n\nI'm curious about the eligibility for post-graduate courses in medicine. Could you elaborate on the condition related to practicing during the course?\n\nEligibility for pursuing post-graduate courses in medicine under this scholarship is contingent on the student not being allowed to practice during the period of their course. This condition is essential for determining their eligibility.\n\nCan you explain the income criteria for unemployed applicants, specifically regarding their parents or guardians' income?\n\nUnemployed applicants are eligible if their parents or guardians' income from all sources does not exceed Rs. 1.50 lakh per annum. This income threshold is vital in determining their eligibility for the scholarship.\n\nI'd like to understand the financial aspects of eligibility. How is the income of employed applicants and their parents or guardians assessed?\n\nEmployed applicants and their eligibility are linked to income. They can be eligible if the combined income of both the applicant and their parents or guardians does not exceed Rs. 1.50 lakh per annum. This income assessment is a crucial factor in determining eligibility.\n\nI'm curious about the study tour charges. What are the conditions under which study tour charges are paid, and what is the maximum amount allowed?\n\nStudy tour charges are paid to scholars studying professional and technical courses when the head of the institution certifies that the study tour is essential for the scholar to complete their course of study. The maximum amount allowed for study tour charges is up to Rs. 900 per annum, limited to the actual expenditure incurred by the student on transportation and related expenses during the study tour.\n\nThe document mentions that certain fees are covered by the scholarship. Can you provide examples of the types of fees that are considered and those that are excluded?\n\nThe scholarship covers fees such as enrolment/registration, tuition, games, union, library, magazine, medical examination, and other fees that are compulsory for the scholar to pay to the institution or University/Board. However, fees that are refundable, such as caution money and security deposit, are excluded.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/csspostmsossi#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://scholarships.gov.in/public/schemeGuidelines/TRIPURA_PMS_OBC.pdf)\n\n[UMANG](https://web.umang.gov.in/web_new/department?url=dept%2F39&dept_id=39&dept_name=National%20Scholarship%20Portal)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n![Image 15: twitter](https://cdn.myscheme.in/images/logos/twitter.svg)\n\n### Something went wrong.
