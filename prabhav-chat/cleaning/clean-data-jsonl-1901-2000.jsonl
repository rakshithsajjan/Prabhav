The primary focus of this strategy is to encourage and motivate rural communities to abandon the traditional practice of open defecation and adopt safe sanitation practices. As part of this initiative, the Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorn Swachata Puruskar (MVSSP) has been introduced.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe MVSSP is an annual competition that aims to identify and recognize the cleanest Gram Panchayat at various levels, including block, district, division, and state. The competition serves as a platform to evaluate the cleanliness and hygiene conditions maintained by Gram Panchayats. Factors such as waste management, sanitation infrastructure, and active community participation are taken into consideration during the evaluation process.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe winners of the MVSSP at the state and divisional levels are honored by the Honorable Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh during the Independence Day celebrations each year. Similarly, the winners at the district and block levels receive their prizes from senior dignitaries. This recognition serves as an incentive for Gram Panchayats to maintain high cleanliness standards and continue their efforts towards improved sanitation.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hpmvssp#benefits)\n\n1.  Block Level: The Gram Panchayat that attains the first position at the block level receives a cash prize of 1 lakh rupees. This monetary reward serves as recognition for their exemplary efforts in maintaining cleanliness and sanitation within their community.\n2.  District Level: At the district level, the prize amount increases to 3 lakh rupees. If a district has more than 300 Gram Panchayats, two Gram Panchayats can receive the prize. This encourages healthy competition among Gram Panchayats within the district, fostering a cleaner and more hygienic environment.\n3.  Division Level: The winning Gram Panchayat at the division level is awarded a cash prize of 5 lakh rupees. This higher prize amount recognizes the exceptional cleanliness standards achieved by the Gram Panchayat within their division.\n4.  State Level: The highest recognition and incentive are reserved for the winning Gram Panchayat at the state level. The state-level winner receives a generous cash prize of 10 lakh rupees. This substantial reward serves as a testament to their outstanding commitment to cleanliness and sanitation practices.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hpmvssp#eligibility)\n\n1.  Open Defecation Free Gram Panchayat: The Gram Panchayat should have achieved the status of being open defecation free.

Previous Level Winners: Gram Panchayats that have won an award at a particular level in the MVSSP competition are not eligible to participate for the same level for the next three years. However, they can compete at higher levels in the subsequent years.\n3.  State Level Winner: The Gram Panchayat that has won the state-level award is not eligible to participate in the MVSSP competition for three years after winning the award.\n\n[### Exclusions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hpmvssp#exclusions)\n\n1.  Non-Open Defecation Free Gram Panchayats: Gram Panchayats that have not achieved the status of being open defecation free are not eligible to participate in the MVSSP competition. This requirement ensures that participating Gram Panchayats have successfully eradicated the practice of open defecation within their communities.\n2.  Previous Level Winners: Winning Gram Panchayats at any level are excluded from participating in the MVSSP competition for the same level for the next three years. For example, if a Gram Panchayat wins the Block level award in a specific year, they are not eligible to compete for the Block level award for the following three years. However, they can participate in the competition at a higher level. For instance, they can compete for the District, Division, or State level awards in the subsequent years.\n3.  State Level Winner: The Gram Panchayat that wins the state-level award is not eligible to participate in the MVSSP competition for three years after the year of winning. This exclusion allows other Gram Panchayats to have an opportunity to showcase their cleanliness achievements and compete for the prestigious state-level award.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hpmvssp#application-process)\n\nOffline\n\nStep 1: Gram Panchayat Resolution\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Gram Panchayat should pass a resolution expressing their intention to participate in the MVSSP competition.\n\n\ufeff\n\nStep 2: Application Form Submission\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Gram Panchayat fills out the application form (Annexure-A) provided by the MVSSP.\n\nThe completed application form is submitted to the Block Development Officer (BDO) by 23rd April each year.\n\nThe application form should be attested by the Gram Panchayat head and three other members.\n\n\ufeff\n\nStep 3: Scrutiny by Block Development Officer\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Block Development Officer (BDO) scrutinizes the received applications for completeness and eligibility.\n\n\ufeff\n\nStep 4: Referral to District Rural Development Agency (DRDA)\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Block Development Officer refers the applications to the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) for further processing.\n\n\ufeff\n\nStep 5: Assessment and Decision\n\n\ufeff\n\nAssessment Committees at different levels (block, district, division, and state) evaluate the eligible Gram Panchayats based on prescribed norms and marking criteria.\n\nThe committees select the best/cleanest Gram Panchayats at each level, starting from the block level and progressing to the district, divisional, and state levels.\n\nThe winners are announced and awarded prizes at the respective levels during Independence Day celebrations.\n\n[### Documents Required](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hpmvssp#documents-required)\n\n1.

Plants are grown inside it by controlling the environment. Where certain types of crops cannot be grown in the open due to extreme cold, these crops can be easily grown by using greenhouses. In case production of crops is not possible due to excessive heat, crops can be grown in greenhouses. In this way, it becomes easier for farmers to grow crops in any season through greenhouses. Greenhouses are mostly used for the cultivation of fruits, flowers, and vegetables. Through this, good production can be achieved especially in vegetable farming.\n\n\ufeff\n\n> **Other important points**\n\n1.  The construction of the greenhouse can be started only after the administrative approval/work order is issued by the Horticulture Department.\n2.  After construction, verification will be done by the committee formed.\n3.

It adopts an area-based approach, focuses on Integrated Farming System (IFS) for enhancing productivity and minimizing risks associated with climatic variability.

This may be in terms of formulating a new hypothesis, or scientific breakthroughs which aid in emergence of new technologies.\n\n> **Nature of Proposals to be Supported:**\n\nThe scheme is aimed at supporting proposals that are new, challenge existing hypothesis, and provide 'out of box' thinking on important problems. It should contain significant risk elements but promise of high reward if the difficulties could be circumvented. It is expected that the success of such proposals will have far-reaching implications in S&T. Outcome could be new and significant theoretical or experimental advances, formulation of new hypothesis, or breakthrough science which will lead to new technologies. Proposals that address scientific issues which will result in 'incremental' knowledge will not be supported. Ideally, the proposal must contain bold research ideas which will have wide-ranging impact and potential for new scientific and technological innovations.\n\n> **Duration of Support:**\n\nThe funding is provided normally for a period of three years. In exceptional cases, the duration can be up to 5 years as assessed by the expert committee.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hr-hrr#benefits)\n\n1\\. No budget limit is prescribed for this type of project.\n\n2\\. The research grant covers equipment, consumables, contingency and travel apart from overhead grants.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hr-hrr#eligibility)\n\n1.  Applicant should be an Indian citizen residing in India.\n2.  The applicant(s) must hold a regular academic/research position in a recognized institution.\n3.  The proposals can be submitted by an individual or by a team of investigators. Proposals submitted by a team of investigators must identify a Principal Investigator, who will spearhead the research objectives and administer the grant.\n\n[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hr-hrr#application-process)\n\n**Step 02:** Applicant(s) should first register into the online website. [Click here to register](https://serbonline.in/SERB/Registration)\n\n**Step 03:** After log-in, go to Menu --> Proposal Submission --> Form Submission. Select the scheme \"High Risk High Reward (HRR)\" and Click on the \"Start Submission\" Button.\n\n**Step 04:** If you have CO-PI in your proposal then it is to be ensured that all the CO-PI are registered in the SERB online portal and have filled all mandatory fields in the \"Profile Details\" section under \"Menu\" ->\"User Profile\" after login.\n\n**Step 05:** Some of the details of your proposal like Project Title (max 500 characters), Project summary (max 3000 characters), Keywords (max 6), Objectives of the project (max 1500 characters), Expected output, and outcome of the proposal (max 1500 characters), Budget (Research Personnel, Consumables, Travel, Equipment, Contingency, Overheads ) have to be entered at the time of proposal submission.\n\n**Note:** The proposals will be evaluated through peer review processes as approved by the Board.\n\n[### Documents Required](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hr-hrr#documents-required)\n\n1.  Biodata (under user profile section)\n2.  Certificate from Principal Investigator\n3.  Endorsement Letter from the Head of Institution\n4.  If the project is approved for SERB support, the Quotations of the approved equipment need to be uploaded within one month of the date of the Approval Letter.\n\n**Note:** Documents required (in PDF) should be in the prescribed format which can be downloaded from the [official website](https://serbonline.in/SERB/HRR).\n\n[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hr-hrr#faqs)\n\nWhat is the difference between an EMR project and a High Risk High Reward (HRHR) project?\n\nBoth EMR and HRHR projects are expected to address important and challenging issues resulting in advancement of scientific knowledge. However, in HRHR projects, the risks associated to address the proposed scientific issues are high, and if it is successfully solved, should result in high reward. This could be in the form of new hypothesis, methodology, process or products, and may have the potential to open up new frontiers in S&T. In other words, proposals resulting in 'incremental knowledge' will not be supported under the HRHR scheme.\n\nDoes the Board has any priority areas for funding HRHR projects?\n\nNo. The Board funds all areas of Science and Engineering without discriminating any discipline. The proposal will be funded if it is conceptually new, risky and challenge the existing hypothesis and approaches. If successful, it is expected to open up new frontiers in science and technology.\n\nCan I apply for a project under HRHR scheme when I am already implementing another project (such as EMR) in SERB?\n\nYes. You can apply and implement a HRHR project, in addition any other project being implemented by you in SERB.\n\nI am currently executing an HRHR project in the area of Chemical Sciences. I want to apply for another HRHR project related to Engineering Sciences. Will I be funded another project?\n\nNo. Only one HRHR project can be executed at a time.\n\nI want to apply for a HRHR scheme for the first time. What is the maximum amount of the grant the Board will fund?\n\nThere is no upper limit (or even lower limit) for a project grant. The budget is decided based on the requirement for its successful implementation. The Investigator should propose a budget which is realistic taking into account the infrastructure and resources available at the implementing institutions.\n\nAre Co-Investigators allowed in HRHR project? If they are from different institutions, can the budget be provided separately to both the Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator(s)?\n\nYes. Co-Investigator(s) are allowed in HRHR project, provided the work proposed require complementary expertise for its implementation. Separate budget can also be provided to the Co-Investigator (s) even if they belong to different institutions.\n\nIs there any specific time-line for applying proposals under this scheme?\n\nSERB is planning to fix time-lines to call for proposals for each scheme. Please look at notifications in websites ( www.serbonline.in and www.serb.gov.in) for information.\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

Creating awareness about the capabilities of differently-abled persons, construction aimed at improving accessibility, purchase of equipment to enrich learning, etc., are the broad categories of assistance under this scheme.\n\n> **Specific Objectives of HEPSN**\n\n> The specific objectives of the HEPSN Scheme are as follows:\n\n1.  To provide equal educational opportunities to differently-abled persons in higher education institutions.\n2.  To create awareness among the functionaries of higher education about the specific educational needs of differently-abled persons.\n3.  To equip higher education institutions with the facilities to provide access to differently-abled persons.\n4.  To provide special devices to higher education institutions that will augment the learning experiences of differently-abled persons.\n5.  To monitor the implementation of all existing and future legislation and policies, which are about higher education of differently-abled persons.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hepsn#benefits)\n\n**Provision of Facilities and Financial assistance**\n\nThe HEPSN scheme has three components. They are enumerated as follows:\n\n> **Component 1: Establishment of Enabling Units for differently-abled Persons**\n\nTo develop awareness in the higher education system and also to provide necessary guidance and counseling to differently-abled persons, it is proposed to establish resource units in colleges in the country, which will be called Enabling Units. The functions of this Enabling Unit will be to:\n\n1\\. Facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses;\n\n2\\. Provide guidance and counseling to differently-abled individuals;\n\n3\\. Create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning; and\n\n4\\. Assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors.\n\nThe special unit will be coordinated by a faculty member to be nominated by the head of the institution. He/she will work as an honorary coordinator for which a token honorarium of Rs. 4000/- per month will be paid. The unit will also have a budgetary provision of \u20b9 50,000/per year towards general administration, stationery, and contingencies, and to avail the services of experts and personnel for organizing awareness programs, counseling sessions, etc., for efficient and independent functioning in order to achieve its objectives.\n\n\ufeff\n\n> **Component 2: Providing Access to Differently-abled Persons**\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.  The UGC will make a one-time grant of up to \u20b9 5,00,000 per college during the Plan period so that the colleges can address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability and make special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning.\n2.  The colleges address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995.\n3.  The colleges ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly.\n4.  The institutes create special facilities such as ramps, rails, and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled\u00a0persons.\n\n\ufeff\n\n> **Component 3: Providing Special Equipment to Augment Educational Services for Differently-abled Persons**\n\nDifferently-abled persons require special aids and appliances for their daily functioning. These aids are available through various schemes of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. In addition to the procurement of assistive devices through these schemes, higher education institutions may also need special learning and assessment devices to help differently-abled students enrolled in higher education. In addition, visually challenged students need Readers. Availability of devices such as computers with screen reading software, low-vision aids, scanners, mobility devices, etc., in the institutes, would enrich the educational experiences of differently-abled persons. Therefore, colleges are encouraged to procure such devices and provide the facility of Readers for visually challenged students. The UGC will provide an ad hoc one-time grant of up to \u20b91,50,000 per college during the Twelfth Plan period\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/hepsn#eligibility)\n\n1.

The application needs to be submitted within two months to be considered.\n\nI don't have the original last subscription bill of my deceased brother. Can I still apply for the Funeral Assistance scheme on his behalf?\n\nWhile the original last subscription bill is listed as a required document, you can try reaching out to the Puducherry Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board to inquire about alternative options.

It gets its favorable temperature only in Highland Pastures. Also there is enough availability of Nutrition's grasses on Highland Pastures. There are also some grasses which are Anti Parasitic and thus help the livestock to remain free from some parasitic diseases. Another most benefit of Highland Pastures is that you don't need to put any expenses on feeding of animals at Highland Pastures.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/isds#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://jkash.nic.in/Guidelines/ISDS%202022-23.pdf)\n\n[Brochure](https://jksheephusbandrykashmir.nic.in/files/LatestSchemes.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.
