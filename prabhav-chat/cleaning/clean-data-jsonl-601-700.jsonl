The iDEX framework was launched by the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in 2018 to support innovation for Indian Defence, and create pathways for adoption of technologies in the Indian armed services, as well as seeding India\u2019s future Defence enterprises.\n\nDefence Innovation Organisation (DIO) is a Section 8 company formed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), both Defence Public Sector Undertakings. DIO implements the iDEX framework, which acts as a bridge between the requirements of the Armed Forces and the solution providers.\n\nWhat is the purpose of IDeX, DIO?\n\nThe underlying objective is to make the country self-reliant and selfsufficient in matters of Defence, through mastering of the fundamentals of identify, incubate, innovate, integrate, and indigenise. The core objective of iDEX is to create an ecosystem, essentially to foster innovation, entrepreneurship and technology development, specifically in the Defence and Aerospace sector. Fundamentally, iDEX fosters the culture of technology co-creation and co-innovation within the Defence and Aerospace sectors.\n\nWhat are the objectives of iDEX?\n\n1\\. To create 'corporate Venture Capital\u2019 models for Indian Defence needs, which would identify emerging technologies, connect innovators to military units, facilitate co-creation of new and appropriate technologies, and create pathways for incorporation of cutting edge technologies into weapon systems used by Armed Services. 2. To transform defence innovation in India with the ultimate goal of delivering military-grade products that solve the critical needs of the Indian defence set-up by developing or applying advanced technologies. 3. To create a culture of innovation in Indian defence & Aerospace by engaging startups and innovators through encouraging co-creation & co innovation.\n\nWhat is the focus of iDEX?\n\nThe program focuses on facilitation for creating of prototypes and bringing of products/technologies to market (Defence or otherwise), applicants will be encouraged to spend on: Research & Development Prototyping Pilot Implementation Market Assessment\n\nIDEX-DIO has launches of Defence India Startup Challenge (DISC) with problem statements from Armed Forces, DPSUs & OFB. After rigorous evaluation of the applications winners are identified. Winner start-ups/ individuals receive innovation grants in technological areas through the Prototype funding guidelines called \u201cSupport for Prototype and Research Kickstart\u201d (SPARK), which entail provisioning of grants upto Rs 1.5 crore to the Startups on the basis of milestones through multiple tranches, for prototype development.\n\nStart-ups, as defined and recognized by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. Any Indian company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956/2013, primarily a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) as defined in the MSME Act, 2006. Individual innovators are also encouraged to apply (research & academic institutions can use this category to apply).\n\nWhat is the procedure to apply for grant in aid under iDEX initiative?\n\nApplicants are required to apply for challenges launched under DISC and https://idex.gov.in/challenge-categories and fill in the application over the mentioned link. The major info sought in application is: Full Details of a Single Point of Contact for the applying entity. We encourage that this person be a core member of the applicant entity (Startup/MSME). Entity Details \u2013 the details of the Startup/MSME applying. Individuals Innovators do not have to fill these. Proposal Details \u2013 the details of the proposal in response to the iDEX Challenge problem statements/focus areas. Applicants must select the problem statement they are addressing, what level of funding they want, give technical and financial details of their proposal. This includes the information of relevant patents and research papers by the applicant, if any as well as a tentative business plan.\n\nIs there any limitation on number of winners selected under a challenge?\n\nNo, there is no such limit. Any number of potential candidate can be selected under the iDEX challenges.\n\nHow grant mechanism works?\n\nThe DISC winners will be funded up to the max ceiling of Rs 1.5 crores (depending upon the costing of the project and matching contribution) in the form of equity/other relevant structures. The funds will be disbursed in tranches based on the milestones decided by a high-powered selection committee. Apart from the fund, selected applicants may also be given entry to accelerator programs run by iDEX partners, where they will be supported in technology and business development through mentorship under the innovation and entrepreneurship experts. The selected applicants may also be supported in terms of access to defence testing facilities and experts for their product/technology development.\n\nHow does iDEX select startups to support?\n\nIDEX has multiple programs, which follow open and transparent processes to identify startups with innovative products for Indian Defence needs. Under the flagship Defence India Startup Challenge (DISC) program, specific challenges are launched to attract innovative ideas. All applicants are put through a rigorous and transparent system to select grant winners, which get technical support and SPARK grants of up to Rs 1.5 cr, with equivalent matching contribution from the startups. Other programs such as iDEX Open Challenges, iDEX4Fauji (i4F), iDEX Internships and others have their own selection procedures as per published guidelines.\n\nSPARK or Support for Prototype & Research Kickstart (in Defence) is the scheme for funding startups selected through the DISC challenges. Applicants showing capability, intent, and promise to be able to produce functional prototypes or to productize existing technologies will be awarded up to Rs. 1.5 crores, strictly on a milestone basis in the form of grant/equity/debt/other relevant structures. The exact amount and mode of each grant is decided by a High-Powered Selection Committee (HPSC) based on the application.\n\nWhat is the next step after being declared as SPARK Grant winner?\n\nOnce a startup or innovator is selected as a SPARK Grant winner after a multi-stage process, the Technical Appraisal begins. The Technical Appraisal is an assessment of the proposed budget, technology / product details, work breakdown structures, and requirements and support required. Once the Technical Appraisal is prepared mutually between iDEX and the grant winner, an Agreement is signed with supporting documents like certificate of incorporation, exclusive bank account statements for iDEX project etc. Note that individual innovators are required to form a startup before signing the agreement.\n\nDoes iDEX provide equity, debt or milestone based grants?\n\nCurrently, iDEX does not provide equity or debt for companies, but only milestone-based grants for Defence-relevant innovative products, under published guidelines. The SPARK Grant determined during the Technical Appraisal is released in multiple tranches, based on completion of pre-established milestones and the deployment of Matching Contribution as per the agreement. Generally, the tranche amount for Tranche 0, 1, 2, 4 and 5 is 10%, 20%, 30%, 30%, 10% of the SPARK Grant. Once the agreement is signed, the Kick-off Tranche is released. For Tranche 3, there is no SPARK Grant, only the Matching Contribution is to be deposited by innovator. Likewise in Tranche 5, there is no Matching Contribution, only re-imbursement of funds by iDEX, DIO.\n\nWhy does iDEX require matching contribution from Grant winners?\n\nIDEX is designed to attract start-ups with innovative ideas products relevant to the Armed Services, and in this process, also create a vibrant Indian Defence manufacturing base. Meeting these objectives requires companies to have adequate capabilities to not just deliver on the product under the grant, to be able to service the equipment over its useful lifetime, and run a sustainable enterprise. iDEX would like its grant winners to expand and become self-sustaining enterprises, which requires a vibrant business plan and \u2018skin-in-the-game\u2019 from the founders. The substantial grant under SPARK from public resources are expected to be matched by matching contribution from the grant winning start-ups, to ensure the incentives are aligned with creating a viable product meeting Defence standards. The matching contribution in the Product Development Budget (PDB) is determined with varying amounts of cash, in-kind resources, and human resources, through a collaborative process between the iDEX Team and the start-up, under robust guidelines. iDEX is designed to support start-ups using public funds with the assumption that this assistance will help develop products and Indian Defence technology companies. It is assumed that start-ups competing for grants will be doing so with full faith and integrity, in the broader interest of the nation. While substantial flexibility is provided with the understanding that innovation requires prompt decision making and frequent experiments, this flexibility should not be misused or abused. Any efforts to extract excess funds from iDEX or under-report matching contribution, despite the flexibility, will be assumed to be in bad faith, and proportionate penal action will be taken, including cross-govt blacklisting for future and withdrawal of all existing grants.\n\nWhat is product development budget and how is it worked out?\n\nThe Product Development Budget (PDB) is an estimate of the resources required for bringing a product to deployment stage, covering capital and operating expenditures, in accordance to the guidelines issued by DIO. The PDB is the overall project cost including the SPARK Grant and Matching Contribution (Cash, In-Kind and Past Expenditure). The PDB is divided in three broad heads \u2013 Prime Costs, Primary Overheads and Secondary Overheads.\n\nWhat all expenses are included in prime cost, primary and secondary overhead?\n\nAnnexure Y (Product Development Budget - Categories of Expenditures) of SPARK Grant agreement defines all three heads alongwith the limits under each head for SPARK Grant as well as Matching Contribution. Category wise allocation of Matching Contribution is NOT applicable if: \uf0b7 TMC is > 2 times the SPARK Grant approved, and \uf0b7 Cash part of matching contribution is equal to or greater than 2 times the SPARK Grant approved\n\nEligible expenditures for grant of money under SPARK?\n\nSince the focus of the framework is to facilitate creating of prototypes and bringing of products/technologies to market (Defence or otherwise), applicants will be encouraged to spend on: a. Research & Development b. Prototyping c. Pilot Implementation d. Market Assessment Detailed fund utilization guidelines will be provided to the selected applicants.\n\nWho all will be eligible for the support?\n\nStartups, as defined and recognised by DPIIT, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Govt Of India. Any Indian company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956/2013, primarily a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) as defined in the MSME Act, 2006. Individual innovators are also encouraged to apply (research & academic institutions can use this category to apply)\n\nWhat is a matching contribution and how is it part of the project cost?\n\nThe project cost is the total cost of the project envisioned, including the SPARK Grant and the Matching Contribution. Matching Contribution (MC) shall mean the cumulative contribution in the form of Cash, In-Kind, and Past Expenditures, made by the SPARK Grantee in accordance to the guidelines of DIO.\n\nWhat is past expenditure matching contribution?\n\nPast Expenditure Matching Contribution corresponds to the monetary value (based on fair market value for intangibles or competitive market prices for others) of all expenditures incurred by the SPARK grantee company in the past specifically related to technology / product development activities, which have been showcased during the SPARK Grant selection process. Point to Note is that actual expenditure on the Product Development starts when PDS defines the problem and SPARK Grant Agreement is signed. Past Expenditure partially covers some of the CAPEX / OPEX used for core product development activities between HPSC and agreement signing period as well as CAPEX upto a year before the HPSC. The Past Expenditure should be less than 20% of the MC for the project.\n\nWho can and cannot be covered under past expenditures?\n\nOPEX incurred before the selection of the winner, with broad limits being adhered to and upto a reasonable proportion of Matching Contribution (less than 20%) may be considered. This form of Matching Contribution can only form a part of Prime Costs, i.e. it should not include any component that would normally be covered in Primary Overheads or Secondary Overheads. Point to note is that iDEX does not endeavour to compensate all technology development activity of the startup. It only tries and cover some of the expenses occurred in developing the technology which will be utilised for creating the product as defined by PDS. Past Expenditure needs to be ascertained by PDs/PEs at the time of preparation of Technical Appraisal and supporting documents verified at the completion of Milestone 1.\n\nWhat is in-kind matching contribution?\n\nIn-Kind Matching Contribution corresponds to the monetary value (based on fair market value for intangibles or competitive market prices for others) of all expenditures incurred by the SPARK Grantee company either on actuals or accruals. Note that it is recommended that only upto 25% of the Salary for Founders/Promoters shall be included in the Product Development Budget under the Primary Overheads. The emoluments for the founder will be decided by DIO before signing the agreement. It is the responsibility of the SPARK Grantee to prove beyond reasonable doubt that all artifacts or IP generated in the past shall be applied or reused effectively. The Grantee is required to submit the documentary evidence to DIO as and when requested by DIO.\n\nWhat cannot be included in matching contribution in kind?\n\nAny amount linked with Equity of the company cannot be considered as Matching contribution or In-Kind. Amount linked with company's own business purpose and not directly related to iDEX-DIO project cannot be considered as In-Kind matching.\n\nHow is matching contribution in-kind expenditure for founder/promoter salary\n\nFounders/ promoters who are working employees of the company and are involved in the iDEX Product Development process. Founder/ promoter who are contributing to iDEX Product Development activities but are not employees of the company. If the said individual is not drawing his salary in cash, then a liability needs to be created in the audited balance sheet of the financial year under consideration. The startup may or may not clear the liability within the duration of the product development with iDEX.\n\nClarification with reference to Annexure Y of SPARK Grant Agreement\n\nCurrent practices ensure that following ceiling limit is under practice: Salary of promoter/founder has been capped at max Rs 2L PM for a maximum of two promoters/founders per startup. This overall limit will be in vogue even if the promoters/founders have more than one ongoing projects with iDEX. Hence max Rs.50000/- each for two promoters at 25% of pay will be admissible even if they are undertaking more than one project with iDEX. This will be negotiated before signing of the agreement. The consideration of valuation of promoter/founder owned IP would be decided based on criticality in the project and on a case-to-case basis at the time of negotiation of the agreement for Matching Contribution. The amount admissible as MC for IP may be capped at 20% of total Matching contribution or the amount Rs. 25 Lac whichever is lower. PDB at the time of signing of agreement is tentative which may undergo multiple changes during the course of Product Development. In all cases, SPARK Grant will remain 1.5 CR or half (50%) the product development budget whichever is lower.\n\nClarification regarding lab infrastructure cost\n\nLab utilization cost has been accepted as part of MC in Kind in case where infrastructure and manpower are not owned by the startup. An agreement with the Lab owner/management and reasonable cost for utilization has been accepted as proof. In case where the lab infrastructure is owned by the startup themselves as on the date of the SPARK agreement, a cost equivalent to the rental cost may be accepted as MC in Kind based on the fair and competitive valuation for the same for the duration of the need. The valuation may be based on equipment, physical infra and manpower needed. The requirement and duration of the need may be confirmed by the PI and valuation from an independent agency may be provided by the startup themselves at the time of negotiating the agreement for Matching Contribution. For the valuation of the rental cost of Lab equipment, furniture and fixtures (except land/ building), depreciated percentage value to be considered. However, notional depreciation will be accepted in cases where the equipment/ item is already depreciated. It must be noted that the total rental value cannot exceed the total cost of Lab. Startup may also explore the availability of such facility with iDEX registered PIs if the same is not owned by them.\n\nCaps for SPARK Grants under various heads\n\nIn a PDB, minimum 75% of SPARK Grant should be allocated to the Prime Costs and maximum 25 % of SPARK grant may be allocated toPrimary Overheads. No fund is allocated to Secondary Overheads from SPARK Grant.\n\nCaps for Matching Contribution Cash, in-kind and past expenditure.\n\nMatching Contribution(MC) Cash is one of the component of MC. Matching Contribution cash also follows the same category wise percentage as SPARK Grant for Prime Cost and Primary Overhead. Maximum 5% of MC Cash may be used for Secondary Overhead expenses.Within the Matching Contribution, at least 50% of Cash Contribution is recommended.\n\nFurther FAQs on Financial Aspects and link for same\n\nHttps://idex.gov.in/financial\\_faq1\n"}]}}

Translation research has gained considerable focus as it has the potential to elevate results from fundamental research to a given technology readiness level, in turn catalyzing symbiotic growth of institutional infrastructure to offer a platform for scale-up of entrepreneurial ventures, supported by a variety of funding mechanisms. SERB-TETRA will challenge scientists executing SERB grants, such as CRG, to establish an effective, functional, and synergistic working collaboration with an industry partner to elevate their breakthrough results and technologies to TRL level 5 and beyond. It is implicit that PIs would have obtained the necessary patents and IPRs.\n\nTETRA Support will help entities have successful ideas to kick-start new venture processes. With seed capital, flexible working spaces, and interaction between mentor and start-up entrepreneurs, the SERB-TETRA will expand the scope by providing numerous networking opportunities, followed by presenting the finished prototype to an audience of large investors, established MSMEs and private companies, and public sector enterprises.\n\nSERB-TETRA would be awarded to select PIs who have clearly demonstrated the translational potential of their research (patents, etc.) and have established contact with industrial partners for fast-track graduation to a prototype stage and beyond. PIs would have also identified technology incubators in their own institution or in the vicinity who could support their endeavors. It is envisaged that a well-defined strategy to augment research innovation, via technology incubators, will add value to the CRG and other funding mechanisms supported by SERB.\n\n> **Objective:**\n\nSERB-TETRA aims to provide awards to competitively funded Core Research Grants (CRG) and similar projects, holding potential and promise for translation at TRL 5 or beyond.\n\n> **Scientific Social Responsibility:**\n\nSERB has adopted the Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy to imbibe a culture of social commitment among SERB Grantees. The policy intends to effectively utilize the scientific infrastructure and expertise of SERB grantees to benefit other S&T stakeholders, especially the less-endowed researchers and society. SSR activities need to be chosen after approval and depending on the activities chosen additional budget would be provided under a separate head to carry out the chosen activities. SERB Grantees need to undertake the proposed SSR activities during their project period.\n\n> **Duration of Support:**\n\n\u2022 The funding will be provided normally for a period of two years.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serb-tetra#benefits)\n\n*   The award will entail an unstructured budget of up to \u20b915 lakhs per year (without international travel), including overhead.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serb-tetra#eligibility)\n\n1.

Rest 60% back-ended subsidy shall be released after the completion of the project.\n*   The beneficiary shall construct the Bio-floc unit as per the minimum design and specification shown in the above tables.\n*   Items from Sl. No. 3 to 6 in the tables are optional. \u00b7 Details of the 4 Tanks Model and 6 Tanks Model are given in the Guidelines of the Scheme.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/piatibft#benefits)\n\n1.  **Increased Productivity:** The adoption of bio-floc technology in aquaculture can lead to increased productivity by maintaining optimal water quality conditions. The technology helps in controlling water parameters such as dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate levels, thereby creating a conducive environment for fish and shrimp growth.\n2.  **Water Conservation:** Bio-floc technology promotes water conservation by minimizing the need for water exchange in aquaculture systems. The microbial communities formed in bio-floc tanks help in recycling nutrients and reducing water wastage, making it a sustainable approach to aquaculture.\n3.  **Cost Reduction:** By reducing the dependence on water exchange and minimizing the usage of artificial feeds, the adoption of bio-floc technology can potentially lead to cost savings for fish and shrimp farmers. This can contribute to the economic viability of aquaculture operations.\n4.  **Environmental Sustainability:** The implementation of bio-floc technology aligns with the goal of environmental sustainability in aquaculture. The technology reduces the release of effluents into natural water bodies, mitigating the potential negative impacts on the environment.\n5.  **Skill Development and Capacity Building:** The initiative may include training and capacity-building programs for farmers, providing them with knowledge and skills related to bio-floc technology and its application in aquaculture. This can empower farmers with the necessary expertise to adopt and adapt to modern aquaculture practices.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/piatibft#eligibility)\n\n1.  Farmers interested to take up grow-out tanks, nurseries, and seed tanks; fish and shrimp hatchery operators; private entrepreneurs; unemployed youth are eligible to avail of the assistance under this scheme. Priority will be given to unemployed educated youth since Bio-floc farming involves advanced technology, and the beneficiary has to undergo specialized training on Bio-floc systems, before the operation of the unit.\n2.  The eligible brackish water shrimp farms/ nursery and seed tanks/ hatchery beneficiaries must have a concerned license from Coastal Aquaculture Authority.\n3.  The support will be in the form of back-ended assistance for the installation of a Bio-floc system inside a shed with PVC/ brick masonry tanks, water supply, drain, and aeration units.\n4.  The assistance under the special package will be available to the above categories of beneficiaries with a minimum of 2 tanks and a maximum of 6 tanks.\n5.  If a beneficiary has availed subsidy earlier for installation of Bio-floc unit under different schemes of Government of India and State Government, for less than 6 nos. of tanks, He/ She shall also be eligible to avail further subsidy under this scheme. However, in such cases, the subsidy shall be limited to a maximum of 6 tanks which will include the installation of tanks earlier\n\n[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/piatibft#application-process)\n\nOnline\n\n**Step 1:** Visit the official website of the [Fisheries & Animal Resources Development Department.](https://fard.odisha.gov.in/)\ufeff\n\n**Step 2:** Click on the \"Scheme\" Categories and select \"Fisheries Scheme\" on the home page.\n\n**Step 3:** Click on Download in the column of the '[Brief Description of the Scheme](https://fard.odisha.gov.in/fisheries-schemes)\" of \u201cSubsidy for Bio-floc Technology based Intensive Shrimp & Fish Farming (2020-21)\"\n\n**Step 4:** Download the \"Brief Description of the Scheme\" pdf.\n\n**Step 5:** You will land on the [PDF Page](https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://sugam.odisha.gov.in/admin//storage/uploads/serviceImg/621dc00b213291646116875.pdf).

Out of the total 5000 scholarships, 1000 scholarships have been allocated to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Railways. On the basis of the strength of the forces, it has been decided that 910 scholarships for CPFs controlled by MHA and 90 for the Railways Protection Force controlled by the Ministry of Railways.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmsswwcpfp#benefits)\n\n> **Amount of Scholarship:**\n\n1\\. \u20b91250/- per month for boys\n\n2\\. \u20b91500/- per month for girls\n\n> **Duration of the Scholarship:**\n\n1\\.

Service conditions of Central Police Forces (CPFs) Personnel are extremely exacting, tough, rigorous, and peculiar to the Services. The service condition often keeps these personnel away from family for long spells. This leads to neglect of family matters including the education of children.\n\nPrime Minister has announced 5000 scholarships for the wards of ex-servicemen/widows of army personnel as well as para-military forces including the Railway Protection Force for pursuing advanced education in the field of Medical Engineering/IT and other technical subjects which would be funded out of the interest income generated out of National Defence Fund. Out of the total 5000 scholarships, 1000 scholarships have been allocated to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Railways. On the basis of the strength of the forces, it has been decided that 910 scholarships for CPFs controlled by MHA and 90 for the Railways Protection Force controlled by the Ministry of Railways.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

This scheme helps alleviate the financial burden on students and encourages them to continue their education beyond the secondary level. It covers various expenses such as tuition fees, maintenance allowance, and other incidental costs associated with pursuing higher studies. By promoting access to education for all, regardless of financial constraints, the Post-Matric Scholarship scheme contributes to fostering inclusivity and empowering disadvantaged students to achieve their academic aspirations.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}
