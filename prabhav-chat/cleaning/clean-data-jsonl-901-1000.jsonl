The scheme is launched by the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Vijay Rupani. The scheme will look forward to a healthy child after their birth. It was decided at the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital and it will look upon the children up to two months after their birth.\n\nAfter focusing on the health of the children and covering some major diseases the government has now shifted its focus to core issues. Basically, the Atal Sneh Yojana will replace the decades-old Annual School Program which was being carried out by the health and education departments.\n\nFor this new scheme, newborn children will be screened specifically to look for health defects and improve them. This is being launched wide across Gujarat. Under this scheme, the newborn kids will be screened and given treatment immediately if there is any illness found. It will be carried out for two long months.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1.  Through this scheme, children can be provided with better health. Better health will lead to avoiding malnutrition, disorders, and diseases.\n2.  Around seven percent of newly born babies every year are suffering from certain disorders and that has created a serious issue in the international platform. So by preventing such trouble, the country can be in a better position in international health conferences.\n3.  With such schemes, the government is also looking for a stronger young generation and this young generation would lead to having a stronger nation.\n\n**some of the dire diseases kids suffer from**\n\n1.  The children suffer from some very grave diseases such as complicated birth defects such as Down\u2019s syndrome, congenital deafness, club foot, neural tube defect, etc.\n2.  These are not all. There are some diseases, which are there present in the dormant state within the genes. By checking the kids at their tender age, the doctors will be able to better treat them.\n3.

The scheme is launched by the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Vijay Rupani. The scheme will look forward to a healthy child after their birth. It was decided at the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital and it will look upon the children up to two months after their birth.\n\nAfter focusing on the health of the children and covering some major diseases the government has now shifted its focus to core issues. Basically, the Atal Sneh Yojana will replace the decades-old Annual School Program which was being carried out by the health and education departments.\n\nFor this new scheme, newborn children will be screened specifically to look for health defects and improve them. This is being launched wide across Gujarat. Under this scheme, the newborn kids will be screened and given treatment immediately if there is any illness found. It will be carried out for two long months.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1.  Through this scheme, children can be provided with better health. Better health will lead to avoiding malnutrition, disorders, and diseases.\n2.  Around seven percent of newly born babies every year are suffering from certain disorders and that has created a serious issue in the international platform. So by preventing such trouble, the country can be in a better position in international health conferences.\n3.  With such schemes, the government is also looking for a stronger young generation and this young generation would lead to having a stronger nation.\n\n**some of the dire diseases kids suffer from**\n\n1.  The children suffer from some very grave diseases such as complicated birth defects such as Down\u2019s syndrome, congenital deafness, club foot, neural tube defect, etc.\n2.  These are not all. There are some diseases, which are there present in the dormant state within the genes. By checking the kids at their tender age, the doctors will be able to better treat them.\n3.  The Chief Minister of the state launched that all of the diseases that are detected at the maternity homes by the government will be taken care of by the government.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

However, it's best to check with the CSC or local authorities for specific details and collection timelines.\n\nDo I need a medical certificate proving my disability during the application process?\n\nYes, you will need to submit a Differently Abled ID card as proof of your disability and the percentage of impairment.\n\nDo I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the benefits?\n\nNo, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.\n\nI am a person with a visual impairment. How can I navigate the application process at the CSC?\n\nThe CSC staff is trained to assist individuals with disabilities. You can inform them about your visual impairment, and they can guide you through the process or even help you fill out the application form.\n\nI am concerned about the privacy of my disability information during the application process.\n\nThe application process adheres to strict data privacy regulations. Your information is used solely for the purpose of assessing your eligibility for the scheme.\n\nCan I choose the color or design of the free dhoti or saree?\n\nNo, the scheme typically provides pre-selected colors and designs for the free clothes distributed during Pongal and Deepavali.\n\nI am unable to collect the free rice due to my disability. Can someone else collect it on my behalf?\n\nYes, you can authorize a family member or trusted individual to collect the rice on your behalf.

If the grievance is related to the district or state, the same will be transferred by the Ministry to the authority concerned through the portal. The District and State authorities are required to redress the grievance online and also update the same online.\n\nThe State Government would be requested to ensure that the information of the State and District level Officer is updated on transfer or change of charge. He will also ensure that all grievances pertaining to the district and state are resolved. The helpline and details of the resource person will be displayed on the portal of the State Tribal Welfare Department (TWD).\n\n**Note:** The Ministry's NGO Portal will be opened for 90 days from 15th July to 30th September or as notified by the Ministry to enable the NGO to submit its application for Grants in Aid.

This is applicable to both ongoing and new projects.\n\n> **Scrutiny and Inspection at the State Level:**\n\n**Step 01:** The online applications will get directed to the account of the State/UT Tribal Welfare Department which in turn will get the projects inspected through a District Level officer. The ministry will provide Login ID and Passwords to users at the State level. The Ministry will also provide a facility to the State for making officers at the district level the authorized users and the State would provide a Login ID and Password to him. It will be the responsibility of the officer authorized at the District level to inspect and scrutinize the proposed project.\n\n**Step 02:** The authorized district level Officer will upload comments about the project on the portal after inspection, upload the Inspection form, duly signed and stamped, and forward the required documents to the State as stipulated by the Ministry.\n\n**Step 03:** The projects forwarded by the District Level Officer will be examined by the State Government/UT Administration.\n\n**Step 04:** The State Committee for Support of Voluntary Efforts (SCSVE under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary/Officer in-charge of the Tribal Welfare Department/Social Welfare Department will make specific recommendations about the application of the NGO within the timelines stipulated by the Ministry.

The short-listed new projects may be subjected to further assessment by an independent agency which may include field-based prefunding appraisal. Detailed notes will be drawn while making recommendations for approval or rejection of the project proposal by the NGO division, also keeping in mind the budget available under the scheme.\n\n**Step 02:** Constitution of Project Appraisal Committees at the Ministry level: All projects after screening shall be placed before the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) under the Chairpersonship of Joint Secretary, Tribal Affairs for final recommendation.
