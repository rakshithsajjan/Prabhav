Proposed by the Government of Odisha , KALIA scheme brings under its umbrella 92% of cultivators of the state and almost all needy landless cultivators , who can avail the benefits of this scheme through Direct Benefit Transfer Mode.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

AGNIPATH allows patriotic and motivated youth to serve in the Armed Forces for a period of four years. The AGNIPATH scheme has been designed to enable a youthful profile of the Armed Forces.\n\n\"Agnipath Yojana\" is a new HR Management scheme for the Armed Forces. Candidates inducted through this scheme will be called Agniveers. These Agniveers once enrolled into the Indian Air Force, will be governed under the Air Force Act 1950, for a period of four years. Endeavour will be made to enroll candidates as Agniveers from all parts of the nation, utilising contemporary technology (online STAR exam and associated testing methods), specialized rallies, and campus interviews at recognized technical institutes such as Industrial Training Institutes, NSQF, etc. Agniveers would form a distinct rank in the IAF, different from any other existing rank.\n\nAs part of the enrolment process, each \u2018Agniveer\u2019 will be required to formally accept all terms and conditions of the AGNIPATH Scheme. For personnel below the age of 18 years, the enrolment form will need to be signed by the parents/guardians, in accordance with extant provisions.\n\nPost the period of four years, all Agniveers will go back to society. However, based on organizational requirements and policies promulgated by the IAF, Agniveers who have exited will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the IAF in the regular cadre. The skills gained by each Agniveer will be captured in a certificate to form part of his resume. These applications will be considered by a centralized board in a transparent manner and not more than 25% of the strength of the specific batch of original Agniveers will be enrolled in the IAF based on performance during their four-year engagement period as Agniveers.\n\nAgniveers will not have any right to be selected for further enrolment into the Armed Forces. Selection will be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government. The enrolment as airmen into the regular cadre of Indian Air Force except for Medical tradesmen, will be available only to those personnel who have completed their engagement period as Agniveers.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ay#benefits)\n\nAgniveers will be given an attractive customized monthly package along with Risk and Hardship allowances as applicable in the three services. On completion of the engagement period of four years, Agniveers will be paid a one-time \u2018SevaNidhi\u2019 package which shall comprise their contribution including accrued interest thereon and a matching contribution from the Government equal to the accumulated amount of their contribution including interest as indicated below:\n\n<table class=\"border border-solid border-gray-300 w-full

There will be allowances and non-contributory insurance cover as well.\n\nCan Agniveers Opt For Permanent Service In The Armed Forces?\n\nAll Agniveers, after four years, will be offered an opportunity to voluntarily apply for enrolment in the permanent cadre. These applications will be considered based on merit and performance during service. As much as 25% of applications will be accepted.\n\nHow Can I Apply For Agnipath Scheme Recruitment?\n\nThe vacancies and joining process will be made available on the armed forces\u2019 respective websites: joinindianarmy.nic.in joinindiannavy.gov.in careerindianairforce.cdac.in\n\nWhat Will The Training Involve?\n\nTraining for Agniveers would be on a par with that of the regular armed forces cadres and would involve rigorous military exercises. The training standards would be clearly defined and monitored by the highest authorities in the Armed Forces.\n\nWho Will Be Eligible To Apply For Recruitment Under The Agnipath Scheme?\n\nFor the 2022 intake, The age range to be eligible for the scheme is 17.5-23 years. For the upcoming batches, the eligible age range will be 17.5 years to 21 years.\n\nCan Agniveers opt for role in the permanent cadre?\n\nBased on organisational requirement and policies promulgated by the Armed Forces, all Agniveers after completing their engagement period, will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the permanent cadre. These applications will be considered by a centralised transparent rigorous screening system which would be based on merit and demonstrated performance during service.

Selection of Agniveers for further enrolment into the Armed Forces will be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government through laid down policies.\n\nHow will this scheme ensure recruitment from all over the country?\n\nAims to capitalize on the broad based talent pool of the Nation and select the best for a career in the Armed Forces. The present pattern of selection into the Armed Forces is not being changed with the introduction of the scheme. The only change that is happening is in the Terms and Conditions of the service. As you all are aware, that the three Services are having well established selections centers spread over the country which have enabled them to recruit people from even the remotest part of the Nation. Since these very selection centers would continue to undertake the responsibility of recruiting personnel, we expect that the all India representation would not be affected by the introduction of the Scheme.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ay#sources)\n\n[English Leaflet](https://static.mygov.in/rest/s3fs-public/mygov_165520214151307401.pdf)\n\n[Hindi Leaflet](https://static.mygov.in/rest/s3fs-public/mygov_165520220351307401.pdf)\n\n[PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1833747)\n\n[Guidelines By Indian Air Force](https://indianairforce.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Detailed-BRIEF-13-JUN-22.pdf)\n\n[PIB (ministry Of Education)](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1834202)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

AGNIPATH allows patriotic and motivated youth to serve in the Armed Forces for a period of four years. The AGNIPATH scheme has been designed to enable a youthful profile of the Armed Forces.\n\n\"Agnipath Yojana\" is a new HR Management scheme for the Armed Forces. Candidates inducted through this scheme will be called Agniveers. These Agniveers once enrolled into the Indian Air Force, will be governed under the Air Force Act 1950, for a period of four years. Endeavour will be made to enroll candidates as Agniveers from all parts of the nation, utilising contemporary technology (online STAR exam and associated testing methods), specialized rallies, and campus interviews at recognized technical institutes such as Industrial Training Institutes, NSQF, etc. Agniveers would form a distinct rank in the IAF, different from any other existing rank.\n\nAs part of the enrolment process, each \u2018Agniveer\u2019 will be required to formally accept all terms and conditions of the AGNIPATH Scheme. For personnel below the age of 18 years, the enrolment form will need to be signed by the parents/guardians, in accordance with extant provisions.\n\nPost the period of four years, all Agniveers will go back to society. However, based on organizational requirements and policies promulgated by the IAF, Agniveers who have exited will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the IAF in the regular cadre. The skills gained by each Agniveer will be captured in a certificate to form part of his resume. These applications will be considered by a centralized board in a transparent manner and not more than 25% of the strength of the specific batch of original Agniveers will be enrolled in the IAF based on performance during their four-year engagement period as Agniveers.\n\nAgniveers will not have any right to be selected for further enrolment into the Armed Forces. Selection will be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government. The enrolment as airmen into the regular cadre of Indian Air Force except for Medical tradesmen, will be available only to those personnel who have completed their engagement period as Agniveers.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

The scheme envisages setting up of Solar Charkha Clusters which would mean a focal village and other surrounding villages in a radius of 8 to 10 Kilometres. Further, such a cluster will have 200 to 2042 beneficiaries (spinners, weavers, stitches, and other skilled artisans). Each spinner will be given two charkhas of 10 spindles each. On average, it is considered that such a cluster will have about 1000 charkhas. A cluster with full capacity will provide direct employment to 2042 artisans.\n\nThe Government of India has accorded approval to set up 50 such clusters with a budget of 550 Crores for 2018-19 and 2019-20. The Scheme is envisaged to generate direct employment of nearly one lakh persons in the approved Fifty (50) Clusters.\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n*   To ensure inclusive growth by the generation of employment, especially for women and youth, and sustainable development through solar charkha clusters in rural areas.\n*   To boost the rural economy and help in arresting migration from rural to urban areas.\n*   To leverage low-cost, innovative technologies and processes for sustenance.\n\n(**This is to inform that as per MSME directions, further Mission Solar Charkha will only be undertaken after the outcome of the Pilot projects is assessed (9 in number) and till such time no fresh proposals will be entertained.**)\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/msc#benefits)\n\n**Project Interventions/Financial Assistance:**\n\n*   One cluster of Solar Charkha would involve a maximum subsidy of \u20b99.599 cr.\n\n**The scheme would cover three types of Interventions, namely-**\n\n> **A.

Am I eligible for the scheme?\n\nNo, unfortunately, the scheme is strictly for destitute transgender individuals who are unable to work and earn their livelihood due to physical limitations. If you have some income-generating capacity, you wouldn't be eligible for this specific scheme.\n\nI am a young transgender person below 40. Can I apply and receive the benefits when I turn 40?\n\nNo, the scheme requires the applicant to be 40 years and above at the time of application. You can apply once you reach the minimum age requirement.\n\nI am a transgender person living with my supportive family. Am I still eligible for the scheme?\n\nEligibility depends on whether you receive financial assistance from your family. If you have sufficient support from your family, you wouldn't be considered destitute and might not be eligible for this scheme.\n\nI don't have a computer or internet access. How can I apply for the scheme?\n\nYou can still apply by visiting the nearest CSC. They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf.\n\nIs the pension amount paid directly into my bank account?\n\nYes, the pension amount is typically deposited directly into your bank account. You'll need to provide your bank details during the application process.\n\nDo I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the pension?\n\nNo, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.\n\nI live in a remote area with limited access to CSCs. Are there any alternative ways to apply?\n\nYou can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.\n\nIs there a specific deadline to apply for the scheme?\n\nNo, the Pension Scheme for Destitute Transgender is an ongoing initiative, and you can apply at any time.\n\nWill the application process cost me anything?\n\nNo, applying for the scheme is completely free. You shouldn't pay any fees at the CSC or to any individual for processing your application.\n\nWhat happens if I am hospitalized for an extended period? Will I still receive the pension?\n\nYes, you will still receive your monthly pension even if you are hospitalized. However, it's important to inform the Social Welfare Department if there are any changes to your bank account details or if someone else will be collecting the pension on your behalf.\n\nCan I withdraw the entire pension amount at once, or is it disbursed in installments?\n\nThe pension amount of \u20b91,000/- is typically credited to your bank account on a monthly basis. You cannot withdraw the entire amount in one go.\n\nWhat happens if I miss receiving a pension payment in a month?\n\nIf you don't receive your pension on the expected date, you can contact the Social Welfare Department or the bank where your pension account is held. They can investigate the issue and help you resolve the problem.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/psfdt#sources)\n\n[Citizen's Charter](https://cms.tn.gov.in/sites/default/files/documents/swwe_e_cc_2022_23.pdf)\n\n[Documents Required](https://tnlegalservices.tn.gov.in/swwe/Annexure_English.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

Under the scheme, the citizens of India will be awarded as follows:-\n\n*   Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar for writing original book in Hindi on knowledge and science-based subjects.\n*   Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar for writing original book in Hindi on Forensic Science, Police, Criminology Research and Police Administration.\n*   Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar for writing original book in Hindi on subjects related to Culture, Religion, Arts and Heritage.\n*   Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar for writing original book in Hindi in the field of law.\n\n> **Objective:**\n\n(A) Various Ministries/Departments/Offices/Undertakings/Banks etc. of the Central Government also deal with technical subjects in their official Work. The difficulty is being faced to increase the use of Hindi in official work due to scarcity of books in Hindi on the subjects based on technology, science, forensic science, police, criminology research, police administration, culture, religion, arts, heritage and in the field of law. In addition, employees do face difficulties in doing their official work in Hindi as they are less acquainted or non-acquainted with Hindi terminologies of these subjects. The Department of Official Language is undertaking this scheme with the sole objective to encourage writing books in Hindi on the above-mentioned subjects.\n\n(B) Various Ministries/Departments have undertaken different award schemes related to Hindi at the national level. Department of Official Language has been made the sole Nodal Department for book schemes related to Hindi. Hence, relevant schemes among the award schemes related to Hindi being run by various Ministries/ Departments at the national level have been incorporated under the scheme. It has been decided to discontinue the other award schemes. If any Ministry/Department, in the future, wishes to undertake any other award scheme related to Hindi it shall mandatorily consult with the Department of Official Language before taking up any such scheme to avoid repetition of the award scheme.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 09/07/2024 | v-2.1.8\n"}]}}
