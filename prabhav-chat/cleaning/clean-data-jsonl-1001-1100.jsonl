However, as long as they meet the eligibility criteria and have not previously received benefits from the scheme, they may be eligible for subsequent applications.\n\nAre there any restrictions on the size of Mandal/Group/Institution/Troupe that can apply for this scheme?\n\nTo be eligible, a Mandal/Group/Institution/Troupe must consist of a minimum of 10 members. There do not appear to be any restrictions on the maximum size.\n\nWhat happens if a Mandal/Group/Institution/Troupe has already received benefits from this scheme in the past?\n\nThe scheme mentions that groups or institutions should not have already received benefits from this scheme. Therefore, if a Mandal/Group/Institution/Troupe has previously received assistance through this scheme, they may not be eligible for further benefits.\n\nHow does the government ensure the fair distribution of grants among different groups and institutions?\n\nThe government or department may restrict the number of groups or institutions in each category based on the availability of funds. This allocation process helps distribute grants fairly among eligible beneficiaries.\n\nAre there any performance-related criteria that groups or institutions need to meet to receive this grant?\n\nThe scheme mentions that groups or institutions should be conducting regular musical performances, such as bhajans, choir singing, folk performances, etc. However, specific performance-related criteria or benchmarks are not outlined in the scheme.\n\nCan groups or institutions use the grant for purposes other than purchasing musical instruments?\n\nThe grant provided under this scheme is specifically designated for the purchase of musical instruments. It should be used exclusively for this purpose.\n\nHow does this scheme promote local talent and cultural troupes?\n\nThis scheme promotes local talent and cultural troupes by providing them with financial assistance for the purchase of musical instruments. This enables them to enhance their musical performances, which, in turn, promotes their cultural heritage and talent locally.\n\nCan you explain the role of local authorities like MLAs, Mamlatdars, BDOs, Sarpanchs, or Gazetted Officers in confirming the functioning of groups or artists?\n\nLocal authorities play a vital role in verifying the existence and functioning of cultural groups or artists. Their certificates serve as evidence that these groups are actively engaged in cultural activities, adding credibility to the application for financial assistance.\n\nHow does this scheme contribute to the preservation of Goa's cultural heritage?\n\nThis scheme contributes to the preservation of Goa's cultural heritage by providing financial support to cultural groups that play a significant role in preserving and promoting traditional cultural practices through their musical performances.\n\nIs there a specific process for the disbursement of the grant once a Mandal/Group/Institution/Troupe is approved?\n\nThe scheme does not provide specific details on the disbursement process. However, it is common for grant funds to be disbursed through checks or electronic transfers to the bank account of the beneficiary group or institution once they are approved.\n\nWhat types of musical instruments can the grant be used to purchase?\n\nThe grant is specifically meant for the purchase of musical instruments, but the scheme does not seem to specify any restrictions on the types of musical instruments that can be purchased. Groups can choose the instruments that best suit their cultural and musical performances.\n\nAre there limitations on the number of groups or institutions that can benefit from this scheme?\n\nYes, the government or department may restrict the number of groups or institutions in each category based on the availability of funds.\n\nHow much financial assistance can a Group/Institution receive under this scheme for the purchase of musical instruments?\n\nThe scheme provides lumpsum grants or financial assistance to a maximum extent of \u20b915,000 per Group/Institution specifically for the purchase of musical instruments.\n"}]}}

It is a paradigm shift from a credit and subsidy-based scheme to a \"fully subsidized scheme\" which creates a sound economic asset with a hygienic living environment for the beneficiary, there by contributing enormously to the socio-economic growth of the individual and as well as the community.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

Since, 2005-06 this scheme has been implemented by the Handlooms, Textiles & Handicrafts Department of the Government of Odisha with the revised title \u201cMahatma Gandhi Bunkar Yojana\u201d.\n\nThe basic objective of the \u2018Mahatama Gandhi Bunkar Bima Yojana\u2019 is to provide enhanced insurance coverage to the handloom weavers in the case of natural as well as accidental death and in cases of total or partial disability. The concerned handloom authority in the state will finalize the insurance coverage, as the Life Insurance Corporation of India administers the scheme.\n\nThe State Governments and the State Handloom Corporations/Apex/Primary Handloom Weavers Cooperative Societies/Unions/ Associations shall be actively associated in the implementation of the scheme by way of sensitizing the handloom weavers to join the scheme through advertisements through print and other media.\n\nPremium Insurance Coverage: The annual total premium of \u20b9 330/- per member will be shared as under:\n\n1\\. GOI contribution: \u20b9 150/-\n\n2\\. Weavers\u2019 contribution: \u20b9 80/-\n\n3\\. LIC\u2019s contribution: \u20b9 100/-\n\nOperational Modalities:\n\n1\\. The scheme is renewable every year and continuation of coverage is ensured only on payment of premium on the due date of renewal every year. The premium amount shall be paid by the beneficiary only one-time for the whole year to the Life Insurance Corporation of India. This scheme will be effective from 1.10.2007.\n\n2\\. The premium, once paid, shall not be refunded.\n\n3\\. Maximum number of renewals shall be effected each year. The insurance coverage is ordinarily effective only after receipt of the entire amount of premium i.e. both the Government\u2019s as well as beneficiary\u2019s share. In an unlikely situation where the Government\u2019s share of the premium is not ready, the LIC shall accept the share of the beneficiary and affect the coverage accordingly.\n\n4\\. The office of the State Director-in-charge of Handlooms & Textiles and its subordinate offices in the field shall be the Nodal agencies for implementation of the scheme. Nodal agency will act for and on behalf of the insured members in all matters relating to the insurance cover. LIC will get in touch with State Directors In-charge of Handlooms for identification of beneficiaries, furnishing forms, instructions etc. for maximum coverage of weavers under the scheme.\n\nRelease of Funds:\n\n1\\. For release of funds, LIC and the Authority In-charge of Handlooms in the State shall identify the weavers to be covered under the MGBBY. The Office of the Development Commissioner for Handlooms (DCHL), Government of India (GOI) in the Ministry of Textiles (MOT) shall release its share of the premium to the Life Insurance Corporation of India directly in advance, based on the number of handloom weavers to be covered under the Scheme. Every subsequent request for release must be accompanied with the note on the performance of the insurance company regarding the claims made and claims settled.\n\n2\\. The Central Government share of the premium will be released directly to the LIC.\n\nMonitoring And Evaluation:\n\n1\\. Monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the Scheme will be done by the State Governments, which will submit quarterly physical and financial progress reports to the Development Commissioner for Handlooms.\n\n2\\.
