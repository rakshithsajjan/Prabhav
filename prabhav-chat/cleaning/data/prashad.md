[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/prashad#details)

Launched in 2014–2015, the scheme "Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD)" is a Central Sector Scheme by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India. The scheme focuses on developing and identifying pilgrimage sites across India to enrich the religious tourism experience. It aims to integrate pilgrimage destinations in a prioritised, planned and sustainable manner to provide a complete religious tourism experience. The PRASAD scheme aims to pave the way for the development and promotion of religious tourism in India.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/prashad#benefits)

The scheme offers a range of benefits for its beneficiaries, which include local communities, tourists, and stakeholders involved in the tourism sector:

> **Improved Infrastructure**

Beneficiaries, particularly those residing in areas with significant tourism potential, benefit from improved infrastructure such as better roads, transportation facilities, sanitation, and utilities. Enhanced infrastructure not only improves the quality of life for locals but also provides a more comfortable and convenient experience for tourists.

> **Employment Opportunities**

The development of tourism infrastructure and services under the Prashad Scheme creates job opportunities for local residents. These jobs span various sectors, including hospitality, tour guiding, transportation, handicrafts, and retail, providing a source of livelihood and economic empowerment for communities.

> **Income Generation**

Tourism-related activities generate income for beneficiaries involved in providing goods and services to tourists. Local artisans, vendors, homestay owners, and small businesses often experience increased demand for their products and services, leading to higher incomes and improved standards of living.

> **Preservation of Cultural Heritage**

Communities living near heritage sites and cultural landmarks benefit from the preservation efforts funded by the Prashad Scheme. This not only helps in maintaining their cultural identity but also provides opportunities for cultural exchange and education, as visitors learn about local traditions, customs, and history.

> **Promotion of Local Culture and Traditions**

The Prashad Scheme often includes initiatives to promote local culture, art, and traditions. This may involve organizing cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and traditional performances, which not only showcase the richness of local heritage but also contribute to community pride and cohesion.

> **Increased Tourism Revenues**

As tourism flourishes in areas supported by the Prashad Scheme, beneficiaries reap the benefits of increased tourism revenues. This can have a multiplier effect on the local economy, stimulating growth in ancillary sectors such as food and beverage, retail, and transportation.

> **Skill Development and Capacity Building**

The Prashad Scheme may include provisions for skill development and capacity building programs targeted at local communities. These initiatives equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills and knowledge to actively participate in the tourism industry, empowering them to capitalize on tourism opportunities and contribute to sustainable development.

[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/prashad#faqs)

What role do tourism information/interpretation centres play in the PRASAD scheme?

These centres, equipped with ATMs or money exchange counters, serve as hubs for disseminating information about the pilgrimage destinations, local culture, and heritage, enhancing tourists' understanding and experience.

How does the PRASAD scheme encourage convergence between government schemes and private sector developments?

The scheme aims to enable convergence between state and central government schemes, as well as private sector initiatives, for integrated site and destination development, fostering collaboration and maximizing resources for tourism development.

How does the PRASAD scheme ensure the responsible use of funds and resources?

By delineating eligible and non-permitted project components, the scheme establishes clear guidelines for project selection, ensuring that funding is directed towards initiatives that align with the scheme's objectives and priorities.

Are there any project components not permitted under the PRASAD scheme?

Yes, non-permitted project components include resettlement and rehabilitation packages, operation and maintenance of assets created, investments in private entities' assets, and land acquisition for development purposes.

What types of infrastructure development projects are supported under the PRASAD scheme?

Infrastructure development projects include the establishment of first aid centres, toilet facilities, waiting areas, and passenger terminals for various modes of transport, as well as improvements in sewerage, water supply, drainage, and roads.

How does the PRASAD scheme promote capacity development and knowledge management?

The scheme broadens travel and hospitality education, preserves tourism knowledge, utilizes local expertise in arts and crafts, and offers skill development programs such as 'Hunar Se Rozgar Tak' and 'Earn While You Learn' to empower local communities and enhance their participation in the tourism sector.

What is the purpose of the online presence component under the PRASAD scheme?

The online presence component aims to enhance the digital infrastructure of pilgrimage destinations through data analysis tools, GIS-based portals, and mobile applications, providing tourists with information and improving their overall experience.

What are the eligible project components under the PRASAD scheme?

Eligible project components include developing online presence tools, capacity development and skill enhancement initiatives, infrastructure development such as first aid centres and directional signage, and restoration and conservation of historic structures and monuments.

What are the objectives of the PRASAD scheme regarding safety and security?

The PRASAD scheme aims to strengthen measures for the safety and security of pilgrims and tourists, ensuring a safe and enjoyable tourism experience. It also focuses on improving the quality of tourism services provided at pilgrimage destinations\[1\].

How does the PRASAD scheme enhance tourism attractiveness?

The scheme enhances tourism attractiveness by integrating pilgrimage destinations in a planned and sustainable manner, developing world-class tourism projects, and promoting heritage and local livelihoods. It positions pilgrimage and heritage tourism as major contributors to economic growth and employment generation\[1\].

How does accreditation of heritage destinations influence the selection of heritage cities?

Accreditation by UNESCO and ASI validates the historical significance and authenticity of heritage destinations within cities, making them eligible for prioritization in the PRASAD scheme\[1\].

Why is tourist footfall considered a crucial criterion for selecting heritage cities?

Tourist footfall indicates the popularity and tourism potential of a city's heritage destinations. Higher footfall signifies greater demand and attractiveness for tourists, leading to prioritization in scheme inclusion\[1\].

How are heritage cities selected for integrated development under the PRASAD scheme?

Heritage cities are chosen based on criteria such as tourist footfall, accreditation of heritage destinations, number of heritage monuments, and funding needs. These factors help prioritize cities for integrated heritage development\[1\].

What is the significance of parity for pan India development in selecting pilgrimage destinations?

Parity for pan India development ensures equitable representation of states on the pilgrimage map. The scheme prioritizes states not covered in the existing list of destinations, aiming for comprehensive national coverage\[1\].

How is the credibility of implementation evaluated for selecting pilgrimage destinations?

Credibility of implementation is assessed through the utilization certificate (UC) pendency of state/UT governments and their implementing agencies. States with minimal UC pendency are prioritized for scheme inclusion\[1\].
