[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/eacvc#details)

The scheme “Educational Assistance for Children of Victims of Crime” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. In order to strengthen the victim support services in the State, the Government of Kerala has launched this scheme which provides educational assistance for children of survivors (victims) of crime.

The trauma of victimization can have a devastating impact on crime survivors (victims) and their loved ones; especially children. The survivors (victims) and their families go through tremendous stress and suffer financially, socially, and psychologically.
