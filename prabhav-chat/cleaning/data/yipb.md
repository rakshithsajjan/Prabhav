The Proposals can be submitted [online](https://submit.kscste.kerala.gov.in/) only on the notification and during the active time.

**Note 01:** Proposals under this programme shall be submitted online only. Proposals submitted in any other mode will not be considered and summarily rejected.

**Step 02: Scrutiny of the Pre-proposal:** Upon receiving the pre-proposal, acknowledgement with a reference number will be issued to the PI through email and SMS. The project proposal will be scrutinized thereafter. Complete proposals with all the relevant documents will proceed further for Peer Review and the incomplete proposals will not be processed further and summarily rejected.

**Step 03:** **Peer Review of Pre-Proposal:** The pre-proposal will be forwarded to 3 subject experts for peer review. The preproposal will be evaluated based on an Evaluation Matrix containing 7 criteria (scores from 5 to 0), as per the following criteria:

0: Fails to address the criteria cannot be evaluated.
