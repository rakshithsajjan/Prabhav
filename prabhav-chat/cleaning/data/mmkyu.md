[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/mmkyu#details)

Launched by the Department of Women Empowerment and Child Development in Uttarakhand, the "Mukhyamantri Mahalaxmi Kit Yojana" is a social security scheme offering a helping hand to new mothers and their daughters. This initiative specifically targets mothers with a family income below a certain limit.
