[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/vs-camcd#details)

The scheme “Vijayamritham Scheme - Cash Award for Meritorious Children with Disabilities” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. The government of Kerala has devised this scheme to provide a one-time cash award as motivation and helping hand to meritorious differently-abled students who have secured high marks in Degree/ Equivalent courses, Post Graduate & Professional courses. Through this scheme, the government aims to mainstream Children with Disabilities and create awareness among them of their fundamental rights.

The differently-abled persons face several obstacles in all spheres of life. Persons with disability are the marginalized groups, who are socially, educationally, and economically deprived. Especially in the case of Children with Disability (CWD), they struggle hard even to complete formal primary education. The Department of Social Justice is bound to guarantee access to a quality inclusive education for all children with disabilities.
