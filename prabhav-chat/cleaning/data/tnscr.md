[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnscr#details)

The Scheme “Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging scholars/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.

With a view to infusing fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these scholars/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.

> **Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):**

The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the [Guidelines](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/TNFCR%20Guidelines_14-07-2023_17072023.pdf), and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Scholars to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:

1\. Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries

2\. Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Scholarship

3\. Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology

4\. Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts

> **Scope of the Scheme:**

The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Scholars of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Scholars will be attached/anchored to that institution.

> **Duration of the Scholarship:**

*   The duration of the Tagore Scholarship is up to 2 years.
*   In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the Scholar won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.

*   The award of the Scholarship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.

> **Number of Scholarships:**

*   The scheme envisages the granting of up to 25 Scholarships in a year.
*   Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Scholarship or a maximum of 2 scholarships in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.

> **Administration of the Scheme:**

The total number of Scholarships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Scholars to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Scholars, through outsourcing or Consultants.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnscr#benefits)

**Honorarium:**

*   The scholarship honorarium will be ₹50,000/- per month. However, if the scholar is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government set-up in India, he/she would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.

**Note:** Essential or mandatory contribution of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.

> **Contingency Grant:**

*   In case of scholars selected as Tagore Scholars under Non-MoC institutions, will also be paid a contingency grant by the Ministry on an ‘actuals basis’ up to a maximum ceiling of ₹10,000 per month and such other allowances/benefits provided in this scheme, and to the extent, as may be specifically decided in each case by the ILSCC/NSC (within the limits applicable in the case of Tagore National Fellows), depending on the nature and the duration of the project subject to the verification of the bills by the Nodal Institutions.

**Note:** For scholars selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.

> **Accommodation:**

*   A Scholar who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Scholarship.
*   The selected Scholar will be entitled to receive a House Rent Allowance of up to 30% of the honorarium. However, with respect to Scholars from University, College, Research Institute or Government set up, HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.
*   MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.
*   In respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Scholars on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement.

> **Settling Allowance:**

*   A Scholar from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of ₹1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of the Scholarship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.
*   Allowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Scholarship for moving out of station. On a case-to-case basis, economy airfare from his/her place/country of residence will be provided/reimbursed upon joining and on the conclusion of the Scholarship.
*   In this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.
*   Intimation in advance is also required to be given to the Ministry by the Non-MoC Institutions. MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.

> **Support to Scholars:**

*   Infrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Scholars to enable them to conduct their research. This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution’s premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.

*   One important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Scholars to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign Scholars engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.
*   Encouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Scholars to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an ‘actuals’ basis, with a ceiling of ₹1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged.

[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnscr#eligibility)

1.  A scholar with good academic credentials at least one publication, either a book or a research paper in reputed journals, and 2 years of research/teaching experience will be eligible to apply for the Tagore National Scholarships.
2.  This scheme also gives opportunities to young artists/performers to apply for the scholarship.
3.  The scholars also need to identify a nodal institution from the list given in [Appendix B](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/TNFCR%20Guidelines_14-07-2023_17072023.pdf) according to their preferences/expertise to conduct original research preferably by using the sources of the same institution. The research work may also include the identification and cataloging of sources available with the institution or the archiving and creation of new sources that the institution should have. (Guidelines for preparing research proposal are given in [Appendix A](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/TNFCR%20Guidelines_14-07-2023_17072023.pdf))

> **Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:**

1.  The selected Scholars will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.
2.  If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Scholar otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship would recommend the Scholars to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Scholars, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.
3.  Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.
4.  At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.

[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnscr#application-process)

Offline

> **Application Process:**

**Step 01:** The Ministry of Culture and/or the concerned institution will widely advertise the Scholarship in the leading national/regional newspapers and on its [website](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/tagore-national-fellowship-cultural-research) (which should give all details) and also disseminate the scheme through professional associations/forums in the relevant fields, so that maximum publicity is accorded to the Scheme.

**Step 02:** Eligible Scholars who can spare time of about two years to do a project based on the resources of any of the participating institutions can only apply during the prescribed timeline mentioned in the advertisement.

**Step 03:** The candidates may submit their [application form](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/Application_form_for_TNFCR_10032023.pdf), prepared according to the prescribed guidelines of the Scheme, to any one of the Nodal Institutions of his/her choice depending upon the area of research proposed to be undertaken.

**Step 04:** Candidates may submit their application form along with a biocatalyst of publications and other relevant documents including a write-up on the proposed work (guidelines are in [Appendix A](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/TNFCR%20Guidelines_14-07-2023_17072023.pdf)), the applicant should enclose a declaration stating that if selected for the Scholarship, he/she will complete the tenure of the Scholarship.

**Note:** The list of nodal institutions along with the other relevant details of the Scheme and application form is available on the [website](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/) of the Ministry of Culture and Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML) (erstwhile Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) under the Scheme Head of the website.

> **Process of Selection:**

**Step 01**: The received applications will be examined by the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) constituted by each participating institution for the purposes of this scheme.

**Step 02:** The applications found worthy of consideration will be shortlisted by the ILSSC.

**Step 03:** The selection will be based on the relevance of the study, the benefits of the nodal institution from that particular study, and the credentials and reputation of the scholar. Only such proposals may be selected

that seek to (a) engage Scholars who have achieved national or international recognition and proven acceptance of their work in national/ international circles; (b) bring out resources that are not yet fully out in the public domain; and (c) publish the work for the benefit of the concerned institution. The selection will be done in two stages.

**Step 04:** The first stage will be of shortlisting of projects and candidates by the ILSSC, according to the criteria broadly specified as part of the Search-cum-Screening process. Apart from considering the applications received, the ILSSC is also expected to adopt a proactive approach to identify relevant projects and search for reputed Scholars in that field, contact such Scholars, and encourage them to submit their proposals. If the received proposals are not worthy of consideration, the ILSSC need not feel compelled to recommend any proposals for consideration by the NSC.

**Step 05:** At the second stage, applications/names of short-listed candidates will be considered by the NSC for each institution.
