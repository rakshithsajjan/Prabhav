[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/csspostmsossi#faqs)

How does the scholarship program define the duration of awards, and how does this duration policy impact the recipients' education?

The scholarship is awarded from the stage at which it is given until the completion of the course. This policy provides consistent support throughout the recipient's academic journey, encouraging them to pursue their education with dedication.

What is the rationale behind transitioning to Smart Cards for the disbursal of scholarship amounts, and how does this benefit both the authorities and beneficiaries?

The move to Smart Cards is aimed at ensuring efficient and secure disbursal of scholarship amounts. It reduces administrative complexities and ensures timely payments to beneficiaries while also offering them a more convenient and secure mode of receiving funds.

Could you elaborate on the significance of providing financial support for thesis typing/printing charges to research scholars, and how this support aids in their academic pursuits?

The provision for thesis typing/printing charges assists research scholars in the final stages of their academic journey. It helps cover essential expenses related to the preparation of their research work, ensuring a smooth and successful completion.

The scholarship document mentions specific provisions regarding income calculation. Could you clarify how income is assessed when a student has one or both parents alive, and what happens if both parents have passed away?

When either of the parents (or the husband in the case of married unemployed girl students) is alive, only their income should be considered, excluding the income of other family members, even if they are earning. However, when both parents (or the husband in the case of married but unemployed girl students) have passed away, the income of the guardian who is supporting the student in their studies should be considered. In cases where a student's parent's income is affected due to the death of one earning parent and falls within the income ceiling prescribed under the scheme, they become eligible for the scholarship, provided they meet other eligibility conditions. This applies from the month in which the parent's death occurred.

Could you provide examples of situations where an applicant would be ineligible based on these exclusions?

Certainly. Applicants would be ineligible if they are studying in the same stage of education in a different subject after passing one stage of education. Additionally, they would be ineligible if they have completed their educational career in one professional line, such as pursuing LLB after B.T/B. Ed. Furthermore, if they are studying in XI class of the Higher Secondary School courses or the XII class of the Multipurpose High School, they are ineligible, unless their tenth class examination is treated as equivalent to Matriculation, and they join other courses.

I'd like to know more about the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries receiving coaching. What are the conditions that disqualify them from receiving a stipend?

Scholarship holders receiving coaching with financial assistance from the Central Government or State Government are not eligible for a stipend under the coaching schemes for the duration of the coaching program.

I'm considering pursuing correspondence courses. How does the scholarship apply to students studying through correspondence courses, and what expenses are covered?

If you're pursuing studies through correspondence courses, you are eligible for reimbursement of non-refundable fees and an annual allowance of Rs. 900 for essential and prescribed books, as applicable.

I noticed that students can accept free lodging, grants, or ad-hoc financial assistance from other sources in addition to the scholarship. Could you clarify the specific conditions for accepting these additional forms of support?

Students are allowed to accept free lodging or a grant, along with ad-hoc monetary assistance from the State Government or any other source, for the purchase of books, equipment, or meeting board and lodging expenses, in addition to the scholarship amount paid under the Scheme. There are no restrictions on accepting these forms of support in conjunction with the scholarship.

Can scholarship recipients hold other scholarships or stipends concurrently, and if not, how do they choose between them?

Scholarship recipients cannot hold multiple scholarships or stipends simultaneously under this scheme. If they are awarded more than one scholarship or stipend, they must select the one that is more beneficial to them. The process for making this selection involves informing the awarding authority through the Head of the Institution. Once a scholarship is accepted, no further scholarships can be received.

I'm curious about the eligibility for post-graduate courses in medicine. Could you elaborate on the condition related to practicing during the course?

Eligibility for pursuing post-graduate courses in medicine under this scholarship is contingent on the student not being allowed to practice during the period of their course. This condition is essential for determining their eligibility.

Can you explain the income criteria for unemployed applicants, specifically regarding their parents or guardians' income?

Unemployed applicants are eligible if their parents or guardians' income from all sources does not exceed Rs. 1.50 lakh per annum. This income threshold is vital in determining their eligibility for the scholarship.

I'd like to understand the financial aspects of eligibility. How is the income of employed applicants and their parents or guardians assessed?

Employed applicants and their eligibility are linked to income. They can be eligible if the combined income of both the applicant and their parents or guardians does not exceed Rs. 1.50 lakh per annum. This income assessment is a crucial factor in determining eligibility.

I'm curious about the study tour charges. What are the conditions under which study tour charges are paid, and what is the maximum amount allowed?

Study tour charges are paid to scholars studying professional and technical courses when the head of the institution certifies that the study tour is essential for the scholar to complete their course of study. The maximum amount allowed for study tour charges is up to Rs. 900 per annum, limited to the actual expenditure incurred by the student on transportation and related expenses during the study tour.

The document mentions that certain fees are covered by the scholarship. Can you provide examples of the types of fees that are considered and those that are excluded?

The scholarship covers fees such as enrolment/registration, tuition, games, union, library, magazine, medical examination, and other fees that are compulsory for the scholar to pay to the institution or University/Board. However, fees that are refundable, such as caution money and security deposit, are excluded.
