[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/mmkssy-assam#details)

Agriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state’s population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana” (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19.

The scheme “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed:

1\. ₹ 5000/- will be provided to each farmer

2\. The number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers.

3\. The assistance is to procure farm tools/farm implements.

4\. Scheme will be implemented on Direct Benefit Transfer by electronic transfer into the accounts of the beneficiaries.

5\. The Selection of beneficiaries will be done by the District Level Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner of the District. The Principal Secretaries will chair the DLC in the case of BTAD and Autonomous Districts.
