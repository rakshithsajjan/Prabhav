Considering the enormous potentiality of tea tourism in Assam, it is proposed to develop 50 selective Tea Gardens as Tourism destinations in a Mission Mode approach.

The development of tea tourism in Assam, besides sustaining the environment and preserving the heritage and culture, will benefit the state by creating employment opportunities and boosting the rural economy.

Moreover, the probable activities under the scheme may be as follows:-

a) Renovation of heritage bungalows.

b) Renovation of heritage tea guest houses.

c) Renovation of the front side of the tea garden depicting all modern tea tourism implications.

d) Dining hall/cafeteria with all modern amenities.

e) Development of swimming pool/spa as part of the facility.

f) Facilities including angling, boating, water fountain, etc.

g) Recreation facility/yoga center.

h) Development of golf courses.

i) Installation of solar lights.

j) Involvement of local youths in proposed tea tourism activities to be developed.

k) Facilities like tea testing shall be developed.

l) Any other facility deemed fit to be incorporated for boosting tea tourism.
