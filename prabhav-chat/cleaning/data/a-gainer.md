**Introduction**

a. The scheme (operated hitherto as Special Scheme for NER) provides financial assistance to institutions located in the North East Region for solving water problems in the campus, providing alternative power support and high-speed internet connectivity. This will significantly address the infrastructural problems confronted by students on day to day basis. The Scheme is being implemented through the Indian Institute of Technology– Guwahati.

b. North East India largely has hilly regions where the supply of water is not regular throughout the year and during the dry season, there is no secured water supply in the institutes. Water harvesting projects are supported under the Scheme for assured water even during the dry season.

c. Most of the urban and rural areas in North Eastern India are deprived of continuous electricity supply, which not only affects daily life but also imparting of higher technical education. The scheme makes the provision of installations for captive solar power energy; at places where the solar energy is not effective, procurement of generators can be considered. Such support will make the technical institutes function better by meeting the shortage of conventional electricity supply:

d. The availability/ connection of the internet facility is also not up to the desired level in North Eastern Region. To mitigate this problem, funding

for setting up an initial internet connection is considered under the Scheme. Recurring expenditures for the future shall have to be borne by the institution.
