[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/nssfp#details)

The “National Solar Science Fellowship Programme” of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy was launched in February 2011. The programme is meant for an Indian Scientist desirous of working in the forefront areas of solar energy science, engineering, and technology with a focus on science, technology, and product development in collaboration with selected prestigious institutions in India. The aim of the National Solar Science Fellowship Programme is to provide a platform to top quality scientists and engineers in the area of solar energy research, to use and expand the resources available at the identified schools/ institutions in the country and abroad to address the complex problems of solar energy utilization for various end uses including power generation.

**Fellowship Management Committee:** A Fellowship Management Committee will be constituted by the Ministry under the Chairmanship of Secretary, MNRE with eminent scientists as members and scientist-in-charge (HRD) as convener. The Fellowship Management Committee will decide the areas of research to be undertaken under this programme. The Committee will also be recommending the institutions for taking part in the Fellowship Programme. The expert members of the Committee will have a duration of three years.

**Number of Fellowships:** The total number of Fellowships at any point of time will be limited to 10 only. However, only three fellows will be selected during the first year of the launch of the Programme.

**Duration of Fellowship:** Duration of the Fellowship will be initially for two years which may be extended for another three years on year to year basis depending upon the progress of the work done by the Fellow.

**Commencement of Programme:** The National Solar Science Fellows will form a community of researchers engaged in frontal areas of solar energy by intellectual curiosity, top-quality scholarship, and drive to understand and find solutions to the application of solar energy and find solutions to the energy security challenges facing the country today. Through this programme, they will be benefiting from all that the Government has to offer, and in turn, benefit the Government in finding solutions to the technological problems of solar energy and their application on the field leading to the visible impact of solar energy in the energy sector of the country.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/nssfp#benefits)

1.  Each selected Fellow will receive a total annual grant of up to ₹32.00 lakhs comprising (i) emolument of up to ₹12.00 lakhs (ii) contingencies of up to ₹5.00 lakhs and (iii) research grant of up to ₹15.00 lakhs. This will be pro-rated for the duration of the tenure of the particular Fellow.
2.  This grant will be released to the host institution for being granted to the Fellow.
3.  The Fellow may also raise additional resources from other sources such as the host Institution, grant providers, grant-in-aid Institutions, etc. for the purpose of carrying out his/her research.

**Note 01:** On selection, the Fellow will be attached to one of the selected schools/institutions in consultation with the Fellow as well as the host institution.

**Note 02:** Selected Fellows shall commit to work at the host institution for the full tenure of the fellowship and shall submit a bond in this regard to the host institution.

**Note 03:** The Fellow must submit quarterly progress reports and a final technical report to the Fellowship Management Committee. The Fellowship Management Committee may from time to time, seek updates from the Fellow and provide inputs and guidance to the project of the Fellows so that the project remains relevant to the Government of India agenda and can be successfully completed on time.

**Note 04:** An annual conference of the Fellows will be held, where the Fellows will be expected to present their findings to the Fellowship Management Committee and other invitees and share knowledge and learning and discuss areas for further collaboration and practical application of their research.

**Note 05:** There would be a visible improvement in the quality of solar technology through the application of innovative solutions/technologies in the field arising out of the research under the programme.

**Note 06:** The resources in terms of manpower and infrastructural facilities available at various schools/ institutions of the country would be enhanced /strengthened.
