[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/sanfsosms#faqs)

I am a 45-year-old woman from an economically weaker section who is interested in tailoring. Am I eligible for the scheme?

Unfortunately, no. The age limit for applicants is between 20 and 40 years old. However, you can explore other government programs or skill development initiatives that might support individuals beyond this age range.

I am a man with a physical disability who wants to learn tailoring to become self-employed. Am I eligible for the scheme?

Yes, the scheme is open to differently-abled men and women, including those with physical disabilities, as long as they meet the other eligibility criteria (age, income, and residency).

Can I apply for the scheme directly online without visiting the CSC?

Currently, no. Applying for the scheme requires visiting the nearest Common Service Center (CSC). They will assist you with the application process, including biometric verification and document upload.

I live in a remote area and have limited access to the internet. Can I still apply for the scheme?

Yes, you can still apply by visiting the nearest CSC. They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf, even if you don't have internet access at home.

I lost my Destitute Certificate. Can I apply using other documents?

While certificates are required, you can inquire with the CSC about the possibility of submitting alternative documents proving your situation, such as a letter from local authorities or a police report.

What specific type of sewing machine is provided under the scheme?

The specific type of sewing machine provided might vary depending on availability and budget allocation. However, it will be a basic model suitable for tailoring purposes.

Do I need to return the sewing machine if I decide not to pursue tailoring?

Yes, the sewing machine is provided with the expectation that you will use it for self-employment purposes. If you decide not to pursue tailoring, you might need to return the machine to the authorities.

I am a transgender woman who wants to learn tailoring. Can I apply for the scheme?

The scheme's guidelines don't explicitly mention eligibility based on gender identity. You can inquire with the Social Welfare Department for clarification on whether transgender individuals can apply.

Will the sewing machine come with any accessories?

Yes, the scheme typically provides basic sewing machine accessories like needles, threads, bobbins, and a foot pedal. The specific accessories might vary, but they will be essential for initial use.

Can I choose the brand or model of the sewing machine?

No, the scheme provides pre-selected models based on government procurement and budget considerations. You wouldn't have the option to choose a specific brand or model.

Can I sell the sewing machine I receive under the scheme?

No, selling the sewing machine is strictly prohibited. It's intended to be used for self-employment purposes, and selling it would be considered a violation of the scheme's guidelines.

Is there a warranty offered on the sewing machine provided by the scheme?

The sewing machine might come with a limited manufacturer's warranty, but the specific terms and duration would depend on the provided model. You can inquire with the CSC staff for details.
