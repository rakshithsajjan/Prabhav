[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmsswwcpfp#details)

The scheme “Prime Minister’s Scholarship Scheme for the Wards/Widows of Central Police Force Personnel” was introduced by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India in the Academic year 2006-07 to encourage higher technical and professional education for the wards of widows and ex-CPFs personnel. Service conditions of Central Police Forces (CPFs) Personnel are extremely exacting, tough, rigorous, and peculiar to the Services. The service condition often keeps these personnel away from family for long spells. This leads to neglect of family matters including the education of children.

Prime Minister has announced 5000 scholarships for the wards of ex-servicemen/widows of army personnel as well as para-military forces including the Railway Protection Force for pursuing advanced education in the field of Medical Engineering/IT and other technical subjects which would be funded out of the interest income generated out of National Defence Fund. Out of the total 5000 scholarships, 1000 scholarships have been allocated to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Railways. On the basis of the strength of the forces, it has been decided that 910 scholarships for CPFs controlled by MHA and 90 for the Railways Protection Force controlled by the Ministry of Railways.
