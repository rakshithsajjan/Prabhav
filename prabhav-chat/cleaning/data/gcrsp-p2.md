[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/gcrsp-p2#faqs)

What is a Grid Connected Rooftop Solar PV System?

In grid connected rooftop or small solar photovoltaic (SPV) system, the DC power generated from solar panel is converted to AC power using power conditioning unit/Inverter and is fed to the grid

How much area is required for a 1 KWp Rooftop Solar PV System?

A 1 kW rooftop system generally requires 10 sq. metres of shadow-free area. However, actual area requirement may vary depending on the efficiency of solar module, and their placement etc.

What are the advantages of Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar System?

• Saving on electricity bill by the consumer. • Utilization of available vacant roof space, no additional land required. • Low gestation period. • No additional requirement of transmission and distribution (T&D) lines. • Reduces T&D losses as power consumption and generation are collocated. • Improvement in the tail-end grid voltages and reduction of system congestion. • Long term energy and ecological security by reduction in carbon emission. • Better management of daytime peak loads by DISCOM/ utility. • Meeting of the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) of obligated entities.

What Is The Average Cost Of Grid Connected Rooftop Solar Systems?

The current benchmark cost of grid-connected rooftop solar systems can be seen in the notification section at https://solarrooftop.gov.in/notifications/view

What is the average cost of Grid Connected Rooftop Solar Systems?

Central financial assistance (or subsidy) is available only for residential sector grid-connected solar rooftop projects only. For other sectors e.g. Govt., institutional, social, commercial, industrial etc. CFA is not available. Central Financial Assistance (CFA)\* to Residential sector • CFA @ 40% of benchmark cost or @40 % of tendered rates (whichever is lower) for capacity up to 3 kWp • CFA @ 20% of benchmark cost or 20 % of tendered rates (whichever is lower) for capacity beyond 3 kWp and up to 10 kWp • CFA @ 20% of benchmark cost or @ 20 of tendered rates (whichever is lower) for GHS/RWA capacity up to 500 kWp (limited to 10 kWp per house and total upto 500 kWp) For calculation of CFA, the PV plant capacity will be inverter capacity or the PV module capacity, whichever is lower. For availing CFA, the PV module and cell shall be manufactured in India only.
