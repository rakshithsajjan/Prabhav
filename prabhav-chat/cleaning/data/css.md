Cancer Suraksha Scheme
======================

BPL

Cancer

Free Treatment

Hospital

Patients

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/css#details)

The Government of Kerala launched the “Cancer Suraksha Scheme” on 1st November 2008 for children below the age of 18 who suffer from cancer and belong to such families which are too poor to afford treatment. This scheme was launched under Kerala Social Security Mission. Those patients found eligible would be registered under the scheme and a Patient Card would be issued. Registered patients would be provided treatment free of cost at the designated hospitals. On further verification, if it is found that any registered patient is ineligible for assistance, the assistance would be stopped forthwith.

Cancer, the killer disease, was once considered incurable. However, advances in medical science have helped conquer the disease to a very large extent. It is scientifically proven that pediatric cases of cancer are largely curable if treated early. Recognizing the urgent need to extend financial support to cancer victims from families, who are too poor to afford treatment, the Government of Kerala launched this scheme.

To provide cashless transactions funds have already been deposited with the superintendents of the hospitals. The patients who are eligible for assistance would receive the benefit from these hospitals directly without approaching the Mission.
