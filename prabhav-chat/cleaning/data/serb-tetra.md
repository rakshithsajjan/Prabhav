SERB-Technology Translation Award

TETRA

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serb-tetra#details)

The “SERB-Technology Translation Award (SERB-TETRA)” is a new scheme launched by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India for catalyzing technology translation in academic settings. Translation research has gained considerable focus as it has the potential to elevate results from fundamental research to a given technology readiness level, in turn catalyzing symbiotic growth of institutional infrastructure to offer a platform for scale-up of entrepreneurial ventures, supported by a variety of funding mechanisms. SERB-TETRA will challenge scientists executing SERB grants, such as CRG, to establish an effective, functional, and synergistic working collaboration with an industry partner to elevate their breakthrough results and technologies to TRL level 5 and beyond. It is implicit that PIs would have obtained the necessary patents and IPRs.

TETRA Support will help entities have successful ideas to kick-start new venture processes. With seed capital, flexible working spaces, and interaction between mentor and start-up entrepreneurs, the SERB-TETRA will expand the scope by providing numerous networking opportunities, followed by presenting the finished prototype to an audience of large investors, established MSMEs and private companies, and public sector enterprises.

SERB-TETRA would be awarded to select PIs who have clearly demonstrated the translational potential of their research (patents, etc.) and have established contact with industrial partners for fast-track graduation to a prototype stage and beyond. PIs would have also identified technology incubators in their own institution or in the vicinity who could support their endeavors. It is envisaged that a well-defined strategy to augment research innovation, via technology incubators, will add value to the CRG and other funding mechanisms supported by SERB.

> **Objective:**

SERB-TETRA aims to provide awards to competitively funded Core Research Grants (CRG) and similar projects, holding potential and promise for translation at TRL 5 or beyond.

> **Scientific Social Responsibility:**

SERB has adopted the Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy to imbibe a culture of social commitment among SERB Grantees. The policy intends to effectively utilize the scientific infrastructure and expertise of SERB grantees to benefit other S&T stakeholders, especially the less-endowed researchers and society. SSR activities need to be chosen after approval and depending on the activities chosen additional budget would be provided under a separate head to carry out the chosen activities. SERB Grantees need to undertake the proposed SSR activities during their project period.

> **Duration of Support:**

• The funding will be provided normally for a period of two years.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serb-tetra#benefits)

*   The award will entail an unstructured budget of up to ₹15 lakhs per year (without international travel), including overhead.
