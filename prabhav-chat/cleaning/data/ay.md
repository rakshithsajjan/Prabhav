[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ay#details)

The Union Cabinet on 14th June 2022 approved an attractive recruitment scheme for Indian youth to serve in the Armed Forces called AGNIPATH and the youth selected under this scheme will be known as Agniveers. AGNIPATH allows patriotic and motivated youth to serve in the Armed Forces for a period of four years. The AGNIPATH scheme has been designed to enable a youthful profile of the Armed Forces.

"Agnipath Yojana" is a new HR Management scheme for the Armed Forces. Candidates inducted through this scheme will be called Agniveers. These Agniveers once enrolled into the Indian Air Force, will be governed under the Air Force Act 1950, for a period of four years. Endeavour will be made to enroll candidates as Agniveers from all parts of the nation, utilising contemporary technology (online STAR exam and associated testing methods), specialized rallies, and campus interviews at recognized technical institutes such as Industrial Training Institutes, NSQF, etc. Agniveers would form a distinct rank in the IAF, different from any other existing rank.

As part of the enrolment process, each ‘Agniveer’ will be required to formally accept all terms and conditions of the AGNIPATH Scheme. For personnel below the age of 18 years, the enrolment form will need to be signed by the parents/guardians, in accordance with extant provisions.

Post the period of four years, all Agniveers will go back to society. However, based on organizational requirements and policies promulgated by the IAF, Agniveers who have exited will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the IAF in the regular cadre. The skills gained by each Agniveer will be captured in a certificate to form part of his resume. These applications will be considered by a centralized board in a transparent manner and not more than 25% of the strength of the specific batch of original Agniveers will be enrolled in the IAF based on performance during their four-year engagement period as Agniveers.

Agniveers will not have any right to be selected for further enrolment into the Armed Forces. Selection will be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government. The enrolment as airmen into the regular cadre of Indian Air Force except for Medical tradesmen, will be available only to those personnel who have completed their engagement period as Agniveers.

[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ay#benefits)

Agniveers will be given an attractive customized monthly package along with Risk and Hardship allowances as applicable in the three services. On completion of the engagement period of four years, Agniveers will be paid a one-time ‘SevaNidhi’ package which shall comprise their contribution including accrued interest thereon and a matching contribution from the Government equal to the accumulated amount of their contribution including interest as indicated below:

What Is The Service Tenure Granted Under The Scheme?

Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveers will be employed for four years and rigorous military training will be imparted to them.

How Much Salary Will Agniveers Get?

The starting annual package will be Rs 4.76 lakh, which can be increased to 6.92 lakh by the end of service. There will be allowances and non-contributory insurance cover as well.

Can Agniveers Opt For Permanent Service In The Armed Forces?

All Agniveers, after four years, will be offered an opportunity to voluntarily apply for enrolment in the permanent cadre. These applications will be considered based on merit and performance during service. As much as 25% of applications will be accepted.

How Can I Apply For Agnipath Scheme Recruitment?

The vacancies and joining process will be made available on the armed forces’ respective websites: joinindianarmy.nic.in joinindiannavy.gov.in careerindianairforce.cdac.in

What Will The Training Involve?

Training for Agniveers would be on a par with that of the regular armed forces cadres and would involve rigorous military exercises. The training standards would be clearly defined and monitored by the highest authorities in the Armed Forces.

Who Will Be Eligible To Apply For Recruitment Under The Agnipath Scheme?

For the 2022 intake, The age range to be eligible for the scheme is 17.5-23 years. For the upcoming batches, the eligible age range will be 17.5 years to 21 years.

Can Agniveers opt for role in the permanent cadre?

Based on organisational requirement and policies promulgated by the Armed Forces, all Agniveers after completing their engagement period, will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the permanent cadre. These applications will be considered by a centralised transparent rigorous screening system which would be based on merit and demonstrated performance during service. Upto 25% of the Aginveers would be selected for enrolment in the permanent Cadre as per the existing Terms and Conditions. Selection of Agniveers for further enrolment into the Armed Forces will be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Government through laid down policies.

How will this scheme ensure recruitment from all over the country?

Aims to capitalize on the broad based talent pool of the Nation and select the best for a career in the Armed Forces. The present pattern of selection into the Armed Forces is not being changed with the introduction of the scheme. The only change that is happening is in the Terms and Conditions of the service. As you all are aware, that the three Services are having well established selections centers spread over the country which have enabled them to recruit people from even the remotest part of the Nation. Since these very selection centers would continue to undertake the responsibility of recruiting personnel, we expect that the all India representation would not be affected by the introduction of the Scheme.
