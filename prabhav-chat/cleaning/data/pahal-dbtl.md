=============================================================

Cylinder

Subsidy

Check Eligibility

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pahal-dbtl#details)

PAHAL (DBTL) has been introduced to curb the diversion of subsidized LPG. Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.

﻿

Before PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market.

﻿

To infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.

﻿

PAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using "Form 5" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC’s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.

﻿

The DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database.

﻿

Such a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further. To confirm this they can either contact their LPG distributor or visit www.mylpg.in and access the individual OMC’s portals. Such consumers will start getting the LPG subsidy directly into their bank account as soon as the scheme is launched in their district.

﻿

Those consumers who didn’t join the scheme earlier but have their Aadhaar number with them can join the scheme and become CTC by getting the same seeded with their LPG distributor as well as with their banks. For those who are not yet enrolled with UIDAI and don’t have an Aadhaar number can also join the scheme and become CTC by getting their bank details seeded into the LPG database.

﻿

**Objectives -**

The following are the key objectives of the scheme -

a) Remove incentive for diversion.

b) Protect entitlement and ensure subsidy to the consumer.

c) Improve the availability/delivery of LPG cylinders for genuine users

[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pahal-dbtl#faqs)

What Will Have To Be Done By The LPG Consumer Who Had Already Joined The Scheme Earlier?

LPG consumers who had joined the scheme earlier by linking their Aadhaar number in LPG and Bank database do not need to do anything. Such consumers will get the cylinder at Market price w.e.f the date on which the scheme is launched and the cash will be transferred into their bank account. They do not have to do anything further. They can check their CTC (Cash Transfer Compliance) status on www.mylpg.in or check with their LPG distributor.

What Does An LPG Consumer Do To Join PAHAL (DBTL) Scheme?

Option I (Primary): LPG consumers who have an Aadhaar number must provide their Aadhaar number to LPG distributor using Form 2 and to Bank using Form 1. This is the preferred mode of joining the scheme. Option II (Secondary): If the LPG consumer does not have an Aadhaar number, he/she can do one of the following: a. Give Bank details to the LPG distributor in Form 4 OR b. Give a 17-digit LPG ID to the Bank using Form 3.

When Can An LPG Consumer Visit The Distributorship For Submitting Aadhaar And Bank Details Seeding Forms To Join PAHAL (DBTL) Scheme?

The LPG consumers can visit their LPG distributorship on any weekday during office hours for submitting the forms. For the convenience of LPG consumers, all distributorships will also remain open on their weekly off day for exclusively receiving Aadhaar & Bank detail seeding forms of the PAHAL (DBTL) scheme till the end of the grace period.

How Does An LPG Consumer Check His/Her PAHAL (DBTL) Joining Status?

To check PAHAL (DBTL) joining status, consumers can log on to the transparency portal of their LPG Company (IOC, BPC, HPC) through www.myLPG.in and follow instructions. On each of the OMC’s transparency portals, a call out with the name ‘Check DBTL (CTC) Status’ has been provided. Consumers can click on this and see the status both for ATC as well as BTC methods.

What Happens Where Transactions Sent To The Bank Fail And How Are They Dealt With?

A) In case some transfers cannot be processed by the banks, they are termed as failures, and the failure cases if any along with the amount is received back from the Sponsor Bank by the OMCs. A report on such failure cases has been provided by the OMC on their portal which is accessible to the distributors as well as Call Centre. b) Payments returned will be re-processed twice in a span of 15 days each and if it is still not transferred, the amount will be kept for payment as and when the bank-related issues are resolved. c) If the amount towards the subsequent cylinder delivered is successfully transferred then the pending amount also will be transferred thereafter. d) The time period up to which such payments will be kept pending will be 3 months or the end of the current financial year whichever is later.

How Is The Quota Of Subsidized Cylinders Worked Out For New Consumers?

A) The eligibility for the quota of subsidized cylinders for all new connections released is on a pro-rata basis. This is also applicable to CTC consumers. b) For new connections, CTC consumers will receive both the advance amount (after the booking of the first cylinder) and the subsidy amount (after the delivery of the first cylinder). c) Thereafter, they will receive a subsidy amount with every cylinder delivery upto the capped subsidized quota of cylinders.

How To Deal With Advance Amounts Given To Consumers When They Are On Transfer?

A) CTC consumers, who are transferred, have to return the advance amount to the parent distributor. In other words, when the Termination Voucher is made the net amount of the Security Deposit of equipment minus the Permanent Advance amount will be refunded to consumers. b) If such consumers are transferred to another district where PAHAL (DBTL) has been launched, they will be given an advance once they become a consumer at the new location and are handed over the Subscription Voucher. c) OMC Software has the provision to capture Security deposits and advance amounts separately and account for them in the ERP accounting system. d) For CTC consumers located in the same city on transfer without any surrendering of equipment and refund of deposit (TTV/CTA), Permanent Advance amount will not be refunded.

How Will The Consumer Know The Status Of His Payments?

Visibility has been provided to the consumers through the Transparency portal of OMCs (via www.mylpg.in). These portals provide separate columns for subsidized and non-subsidized cylinder delivery, the amount paid to the consumer. A call center with a dashboard on all transactions is available for suitable consumer grievance redressal.

Consumers can visit his/her concerned bank with their Aadhaar number and/or account details to know the reason for failed transactions. In some cases OMC the call center can also help with the reason why banks have sent the correct error code to OMCs.
