Double Bedroom Housing Scheme (2BHK Scheme)
===========================================

Housing

Shelter

[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/dbhs-2bhks#details)

The government of Telangana formulated the double bed room housing scheme in the month of October 2015 with a view to providing dignity to the poor by providing 100% subsidized housing. There is no beneficiary contribution under this scheme which is one of its kind. In rural areas, beneficiaries solely depend on seasonal conditions for their earnings, the 2BHK housing helped in protecting them from debt traps as was the case in the past.

﻿

Hitherto the old yardstick was to provide a 260 sqft house with a single room; The "Double Bedroom Housing" provides two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen and two toilets covering the 560 Sqft plinth area. The plot area is 125 sq yards for an independent house in a rural area and worked out to 36 Sq yards of undivided land share in G++ pattern houses in urban areas. The land is thus provided free of cost apart from the cost of the dwelling unit.

﻿

This is perhaps the only State in the Country to launch such a liberal scheme for the poor. Under this scheme, the beneficiaries neither take a loan nor contribute which is a great boon for rural and urban poor families, for acquiring a dwelling unit. It is a paradigm shift from a credit and subsidy-based scheme to a "fully subsidized scheme" which creates a sound economic asset with a hygienic living environment for the beneficiary, there by contributing enormously to the socio-economic growth of the individual and as well as the community.
