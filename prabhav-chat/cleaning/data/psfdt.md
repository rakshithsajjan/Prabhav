[### Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/psfdt#faqs)

I am a transgender person above 40 and have a disability, but I can still work part-time. Am I eligible for the scheme?

No, unfortunately, the scheme is strictly for destitute transgender individuals who are unable to work and earn their livelihood due to physical limitations. If you have some income-generating capacity, you wouldn't be eligible for this specific scheme.

I am a young transgender person below 40. Can I apply and receive the benefits when I turn 40?

No, the scheme requires the applicant to be 40 years and above at the time of application. You can apply once you reach the minimum age requirement.

I am a transgender person living with my supportive family. Am I still eligible for the scheme?

Eligibility depends on whether you receive financial assistance from your family. If you have sufficient support from your family, you wouldn't be considered destitute and might not be eligible for this scheme.

I don't have a computer or internet access. How can I apply for the scheme?

You can still apply by visiting the nearest CSC. They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf.

Is the pension amount paid directly into my bank account?

Yes, the pension amount is typically deposited directly into your bank account. You'll need to provide your bank details during the application process.

Do I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the pension?

No, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.

I live in a remote area with limited access to CSCs. Are there any alternative ways to apply?

You can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.

Is there a specific deadline to apply for the scheme?

No, the Pension Scheme for Destitute Transgender is an ongoing initiative, and you can apply at any time.

Will the application process cost me anything?

No, applying for the scheme is completely free. You shouldn't pay any fees at the CSC or to any individual for processing your application.

What happens if I am hospitalized for an extended period? Will I still receive the pension?

Yes, you will still receive your monthly pension even if you are hospitalized. However, it's important to inform the Social Welfare Department if there are any changes to your bank account details or if someone else will be collecting the pension on your behalf.

Can I withdraw the entire pension amount at once, or is it disbursed in installments?

The pension amount of ₹1,000/- is typically credited to your bank account on a monthly basis. You cannot withdraw the entire amount in one go.

What happens if I miss receiving a pension payment in a month?

If you don't receive your pension on the expected date, you can contact the Social Welfare Department or the bank where your pension account is held. They can investigate the issue and help you resolve the problem.
