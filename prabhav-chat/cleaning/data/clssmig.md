What is Affordable Housing through Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for MIG?

Under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme, beneficiaries of Middle-Income Group (MIG) can seek housing loans from Banks, Housing Finance Companies and other such institutions for acquisition/ construction of house (including re-purchase). The credit linked subsidy will be available only for loan amounts upto Rs. 9 lakhs for MIG-I and Rs 12 lakhs for MIG-II and such loans would be eligible for an interest subsidy at the rate of 4 % and 3% respectively for a tenure of 20 years or during tenure of loan whichever is lower. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the interest subsidy will be calculated at a discount rate of 9%. Any additional loan amount beyond the limit will be at non-subsidized rate. However, the carpet area of the house should be strictly restricted within the permissible carpet area of 160 sq m and 200 sq m for MIG-I and MIG-II categories respectively.

What are the income norms for various categories?

MIG I households with an annual income more than Rs.6 lakh and up to Rs.12 lakh. MIG II households with an annual income more than Rs. 12 lakh and up to Rs. 18 lakh.

When was the PMAY scheme launched by the Government for MIG?

CLSS under vertical of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana -Urban for Middle Income Groups was launched by the Government of India with the effect from January 1, 2017.

What is the process of crediting the interest subsidy?

The subsidy is released by the CNAs based on the disbursements made by PLIs to the beneficiaries. Subsidy, disbursed by the CNA to the PLI, is credited by the PLI to the borrower's home loan account upfront by deducting it from the principal loan amount. As a result, the borrower will pay EMI on the remainder of the principal loan amount.

What is the role of States/ UTs/ ULBs for Affordable Housing through Credit Linked Subsidy scheme?

Role of States/UTs/ULBs under this vertical would be as under: States/UTs/ULBs/PLIs shall ensure link beneficiary identification through Aadhaar for de-duplication. State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA) identified by State/UT for implementing the PMAY(U) will facilitate the identified eligible beneficiaries in getting approvals and documents, etc. to avail of Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme.

Who are the Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) and what is their role in disbursal of subsidy under CLSS to PLIs?

As of now, HUDCO, NHB and SBI have been identified as CNAs to channelize the credit linked subsidy to the PLIs and monitor the progress of CLSS. Ministry may notify other Institutions as CNA in future.

Which are the PLIs through whom this interest subsidy is released or credited?

Primary Lending Institutions such as Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCB), Housing Finance Companies (HFCs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), State Cooperative Banks, Urban Cooperative Banks (Scheduled as well as Non-scheduled), Small Finance Banks (as approved by the Reserve Bank of India) and Non-Banking Financial Company-Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs) (as registered with Reserve Bank of India) which have signed MoUs with any one of the CNAs.

Whether PLIs have to sign MoUs with CNAs for claiming subsidies?

Yes, PLIs can register with any CAN after signing MoU as provided in Annexure-I in the PMAY (U) guidelines.

How subsidy is disbursed to the CNAs?

An advance subsidy is released to each CNA at the start of the scheme. Subsequent amount of credit linked subsidy will be released to the CNAs after 70% utilization of earlier amounts based on claims raised by CNAs.

What happens when the subsidy has already been disbursed, but due to certain reasons, the construction of the house is stalled?

In cases where the construction of house is not completed within 36 months from the date of release of the first disbursement, subsidy is to be recovered by the PLI and refunded to the CNA who had released the subsidy.

Since the subsidy is released to the PLI post claim, does it mean that PLI has to charge the EMI on the entire loan amount and after the CLSS claim amount is released, adjust the same to the loan and thereafter calculate the revised EMI payable by the beneficiary?

Yes

Is there any limit or upper cap on the value (Cost) of the property for which home loan can be availed?

The disbursal of subsidy amount is in maximum of 4 instalments whereas a builder could demand construction linked instalments in more than this number. How to deal with such cases?

In such cases, the number of disbursal instalments can be decided based on the discussions between CNAs and PLIs for availing the benefit under the CLSS, provided all other requirements of the scheme are complied with.

Whether MoHUA is contemplating to share the burden, where a loan becomes NPA and the PLI concerned is unable to recover the entire outstanding amount from the beneficiaries?

It is the responsibility of the PLIs to carry out due diligence of the borrower as per their due diligence norms and as such recovery of NPAs, if any, is their responsibility. However, where the construction of the unit is stalled due to any reason, the subsidy released by MoHUA is to be recovered along with loan recovery by the PLI.

Is there any State Government sponsorship or approval required for availing benefits under this scheme for Private Developers?

No
