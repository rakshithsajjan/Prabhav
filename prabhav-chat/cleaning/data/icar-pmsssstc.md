What is the Procedure of Selection for this scheme?

The scheme provides for the award of 240 scholarships every year. These scholarships will be earmarked for individual Agricultural Universities in proportion to the actual number of scheduled castes / scheduled tribes candidates admitted. A tentative distribution of scholarships will first be made to various agricultural universities on the basis of seats reserved by the individual agricultural universities for SC/ST candidates. The actual number of scholarship allotted to the universities every year would, however, be determined on the basis of actual SC/ST students admitted so as to maintain approximately equal proportion between the number of SC/ST students admitted in each university to the number of scholarships available.

Will Scholarship During The Leave On Medical Grounds Be Admissible?

Yes, Scholarship during the leave on medical grounds will be admissible as follows:- (i) Full scholarship will be paid if the absence does not exceed two months due to illness supported by medical certificate as prescribed by the concerned university.
