This strategy has led to significant progress, with the state achieving almost universal sanitation coverage and all Panchayats claiming Open Defecation Free (ODF) status. To further incentivize and acknowledge exceptional efforts in the field of sanitation, the government introduced the Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP), Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorna Swachata Puraskar (MVSSP), and the School Sanitation Reward Scheme.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe School Sanitation Reward Scheme aims to enhance sanitation facilities and promote hygiene education in schools. Schools that meet the eligibility criteria, including the availability of toilets, urinals, hand washing facilities, safe drinking water, and waste management systems, can participate in the scheme. Assessment committees are formed at the block and district levels to evaluate schools based on specific criteria, and winners are selected accordingly. The scheme provides cash awards and certificates of appreciation to the cleanest primary, middle, and high/senior secondary schools at both block and district levels. The prize money is intended to be utilized for further improving sanitation facilities within the winning schools. With these initiatives, the government of Himachal Pradesh aims to foster sustainable sanitation practices and create a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations in the state's rural areas.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ssrs#benefits)\n\nImproved Sanitation Facilities: The School Sanitation Reward Scheme encourages schools to enhance their sanitation facilities, including the availability of toilets, urinals, hand washing facilities, and waste management systems. This leads to improved hygiene practices and a healthier environment for students.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHygiene Education: The scheme emphasizes the importance of hygiene education in schools. By participating in the scheme, schools are motivated to incorporate hygiene education into their curriculum, raising awareness among students about the significance of maintaining personal hygiene and cleanliness.\n\n\ufeff\n\nBehavioral Change: The scheme plays a crucial role in fostering behavioral change among students. By promoting good sanitation practices and hygiene education, it instills positive habits and attitudes towards sanitation, which can have long-term benefits in terms of overall health and well-being.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHealthy Learning Environment: Adequate sanitation facilities and hygiene practices create a healthy learning environment for students. Access to clean toilets, hand washing facilities, and safe drinking water reduces the risk of diseases, enhances student attendance, and improves concentration and academic performance.\n\n\ufeff\n\nCommunity Engagement: The School Sanitation Reward Scheme involves various stakeholders, such as teachers, school management, local NGOs, and Gram Panchayats. This promotes community engagement and collective efforts towards achieving sustainable sanitation goals, creating a sense of ownership and responsibility among all stakeholders.\n\n\ufeff\n\nRecognition and Motivation: The scheme provides recognition and incentives to schools that excel in sanitation and hygiene education. The cash awards and certificates of appreciation serve as motivation for schools to maintain and improve their sanitation facilities, fostering a healthy competitive spirit among educational institutions.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSustainable Sanitation Practices: By integrating sanitation and hygiene education into the school system, the scheme aims to create a culture of sustainable sanitation practices. Students who are exposed to proper sanitation habits at an early age are likely to carry these practices into adulthood, contributing to the long-term goal of building a sustainable and hygienic society.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ssrs#eligibility)\n\nTo participate and compete in the School Sanitation Reward Scheme, schools in rural areas of Himachal Pradesh must satisfy the following preconditions:\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.  Co-educational schools with 40 or fewer students should have at least one toilet unit with two toilet seats designated for both boys and girls.\n2.

Schools that meet the eligibility criteria, including the availability of toilets, urinals, hand washing facilities, safe drinking water, and waste management systems, can participate in the scheme.

Suggestive technological solutions to address challenges in the supply of drinking water are as under: Solar energy based stand-alone water supply systems for scattered/ isolated/ tribal/ hilly villages. Community Water Purification Plant (CWPP) in groundwater contaminated areas. In cold deserts, solutions may be explored to enhance and store run-off water in small tanks - traditional water harvesting structure, i.e. Zings of Ladakh. Further, artificial glacial reservoirs may be created by diverting the run-off to freeze & store as glacier. In hard rock areas, bore-blast technique, fracture seal cementation, stream blasting, etc. may be explored. In hilly areas, adopting spring-based sources, rain water harvesting and standalone bore-well systems (if feasible) will be explored. In coastal areas, energy efficient small desalination plants with high recovery ratio will be explored, along with construction of sub-surface dykes in rivers. Use of Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS) software, etc., will be required for planning and monitoring.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/jjm#sources)\n\n[Scheme Guidelines](https://jalshakti-ddws.gov.in/sites/default/files/JJM_Operational_Guidelines.pdf)\n\n[Dashboard](https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.
