NRLM has the mandate of reaching out to 100 million rural poor in 6 lakh villages across the country. The poor have innate capabilities to overcome poverty. NRLM strives towards unleashing this entrepreneurial capability by creating appropriate platforms for the poor through a dedicated and sensitive support structures.\n\nHow Is It Different From Swarna Jyanti Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY)?\n\nNRLM has adopted \u2018demand driven\u2019 strategy, in place of SGSY\u2019s \u2018allocation based\u2019 strategy. This implies that under NRLM, states have greater autonomy to plan for implementing the programme. NRLM encourages states to prepare State Perspective for Implementation Plans (SPIP) for seven years and Annual Action Plans (AAPs). The allocation for the state is released against the approved AAP. NRLM has adopted a Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) instead of the BPL to identify its beneficiaries.\n\nWhat Are The Key Features Of NRLM?\n\nNRLM rests on three major pillars \u2013 universal social mobilization, financial inclusion and livelihoods enhancement. It works towards bringing at least one member (preferably a woman) from all poor families into the SHG network. The SHGs and their federations offer their members services such as savings, credit and livelihoods support. As the Institutions of the Poor (IoP) mature, they are facilitated to take up livelihoods/income-generating activities.\n\nHow Is NRLM Being Implemented?\n\nNRLM has put in place a dedicated, sensitive support structure to facilitate the creation and functioning of IoP. The SRLMs are given the responsibility of implementing the programme in the states based on their States Perspective Implementation Plans (SPIPs) and Annual Action Plans (AAPs). District Mission Management Units (DMMU) and Block Mission Management Units (BMMU) are established to implement the programme. At the national level, the National Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (NRLPS) has been set up to serve as the technical support agency to NRLM. NRLPS supports the SRLMs in strategizing, planning and implementing NRLM.\n\nWho Are Eligible For Benefits Under NRLM?\n\nThe NRLM Target Households (NTH) are identified through the Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) instead of the BPL. The PIP is a community-driven process where the CBOs themselves dentify the poor in the village using participatory tools. The list of poor identified by the CBO is vetted by the Gram Sabha.\n\nWhat Are Institutions Of The Poor (IOPs)?\n\nSHGs, their federations at the village, cluster levels and beyond, and other collectives of the poor constitute Institutions of Poor (IoP). SHGs are affinity-based homogenous groups of 10-20 members (usually women). They follow five cardinal principles or Panchsutra (regular meetings, regular savings, internal lending, regular repayment and bookkeeping). The SHGs are federated at the village (Village Organisation), sub-block and higher levels. They are supported to become self-sufficient and community-managed institutions over time. Institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their village level and higher level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and resources for the poor, and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them. They also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In case of special SHGs i.e. groups in remote tribal areas and in difficult areas, groups with vulnerable persons like disabled persons, the group may be as small as 5 members. Only for groups to be formed with Persons with disabilities, and other special categories like elders, transgender, NRLM will have both men and women in the SHGs.\n\nWhat Are The Functions Of The Group?\n\nSHGs are affinity-based savings and credit groups to begin with. They offer solidarity. They provide microfinance services \u2013 savings, credit, bank linkages, insurance, remittances, equity etc. They also offer collectivization and group activities. The SHGs offer social security and social action in various fronts including health, nutrition, food, gender, convergence etc., directly or through their federations.\n\nWhat Is The Role Of The Bookkeeper?\n\nThe bookkeeper of the SHG is a literate member of the group or any literate person known to the group members. The bookkeeper is selected by the SHG members and is trained in SHG bookkeeping. A SHG has 4-7 books \u2013 member passbook, minutes book, attendance and savings book, cash book, loan ledger, activity/enterprise book(s) etc.\n\nWhat is the role of the SHG leader?\n\nThe SHG leaders motivate the SHG to follow the Panchasutra. They serve as the link between the SHG and other institutions such as banks.\n\nNRLM\u2019s priority is to reach out to the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalized. It begins with targeting women and they are considered as representatives of their households. In case of extremely vulnerable persons like Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), elders etc., NRLM mobilizes both men and women. Further, other interventions of NRLM like Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs), Aajeevika Skills would reach out to poor in general.\n\nWill Aajeevika Strengthen All Existing SHGs And Federations Of The Poor?\n\nThere are existing institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. NRLM strives to build on what exists on ground in terms of SHGs of poor and their federations. After assessing the existing mobilization, NRLM mobilizes the remaining poor in a saturation basis. The new and existing institutions would be strengthened to become selfsustaining accountable and transparent institutions serving the needs of their members. All NRLM compliant institutions would be eligible institutions would receive funds like revolving fund, community investment fund and interest subvention.\n\nHow Many Blocks Is NRLM Being Implemented In?\n\nNRLM is presently working in 1009 blocks in an \u2018intensive\u2019 mode. Of these, 50 blocks are being developed as resource blocks to create local human and social capital (IoPs, internal Community Resource Persons (CRPs) etc.) that would support in implementing NRLM in other blocks. The implementation in resource blocks is supported by National Resource Organisations (NROs) such as SERP (AP), Jeevika (Bihar), Kudumbashree (Kerala) etc. In about 50 blocks, NRLM is partnering with existing Federations and NGOs to saturate the block. In the remaining intensive blocks, the NRLM is fielding its field implementation teams. NRLM\u2019s presence in the remaining blocks in the country, referred as non-intensive blocks, is limited to the extent of supporting the existing mobilization, strengthening the existing institutions, providing revolving fund and bank linkages, and taking up other activities in a limited way.\n\nHow Are Partners Taken Aboard In NRLM?\n\nNRLM works with a variety of organizations for various purposes. It has identified the SRLMs of certain states (AP, Kerala and Bihar) and NROs for implementation support. It has identified National Support Organisations (NSOs) such as PRADAN to provide thematic support. NRLM has also forged partnerships with Capacity Building Agencies (CBAs) and Academic and Management Institutes to meet its capacity building and technical assistance needs. It has also entered into partnerships with CBOs and NGOs to implement the programme in certain blocks of the country. The NRLPS identifies and empanels these organizations while the SRLMs take their services directly. SRLMs also identify and partner with various partner organizations on their own.\n\nHow Are The SHGs Supported Under NRLM?\n\nSupport to the SHGs of poor is in terms of knowledge, skills, funds, bank linkages and interest subvention. NRLM ensures that the poor are provided with the requisite knowledge and skills to the members, the leaders and the bookkeepers of the SHGs for: managing their institutions, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, etc. A multi-pronged approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders.\n\nWhat Other Measures Has NRLM Taken Towards Financial Inclusion?\n\nNRLM facilitates the SHGs to open and operate bank accounts and bank linkages. It also facilitates access to insurance to members. It is encouraging individual members too to open bank accounts.\n\nWhat Is A Micro Plan Of An SHG?\n\nMicro planning is a process where members are encouraged to recognize, understand and evaluate their resources; analyze challenges they face; identify needs and make future plans to overcome vulnerabilities by making optimum utilization of resources and fostering convergences. The SHGs receive their CIF only on developing their micro plans or microcredit plans.\n\nWhat Is Aajeevika Skills Development Programme (ASDP)?\n\nASDP, Aajeevika Skills, gives young people from poor communities an opportunity to upgrade their skills and enter the skilled work force in growing sectors of the economy. Skill Training and Placement projects are run in partnership with public, private, non-government and/or community organizations.\n\nWho Will Be Eligible To Be Selected For Skills And Placement Under ASDP?\n\nTrainees between the age of 18-35 yrs and who belong to a rural poor household \\[that has been identified as being poor following the participatory identification of the poor (PIP) process undertaken as part of Aaajevika are eligible under ASDP. Till such time PIP is completed, BPL status or vetting by Gram Panchayat saying the candidate is from poor background, would suffice for being eligible for this selection under Skills and Placement under ASDP.\n\nPIAs (Project Implementing Agencies) are for profit or not-for-profit registered entities identified by ASDP for skilling and placing the identified youth in various sectors as per their interest.\n\nWhat Kind Of Training And Support Is Available Under The Aajeevika Skills?\n\nYouth identified under the programme get skilled in wide range of trades, including IT and soft skills. After training and placement, support is provided in terms of finding accommodation, opening a bank account when placed outside the home district and counseling at workplace.\n\nIs There Any Self-Employment Generation Component In Aajeevika?\n\nAajeevika is encouraging public sector banks to set up Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) in all districts of the country on line lines of Rural Development Self-Employment Institute (RUDSETI) model for promoting self-employment. National Academy of RUDSETIs is supporting RSETIs in this effort. RSETIs provide self-employment training and link the candidates with bank loans for taking up self-employment. NRLM provides the costs of the training to RSETIs.\n\nHow Does NRLM Support Farm-Based Livelihoods?\n\nMahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), launched in 2010-11, is a special programme for livelihood enhancement under NRLM. It is a concerted effort to recognize the role of women in agriculture and an investment is being made to enhance their capacities and increase their income. The MKSP has two streams \u2013 Agriculture (and Livestock) and NTFP (Non-timber Forest Produce).\n"}]}}

Am I eligible for the scheme?\n\nYes, the scheme is open to differently-abled men and women, including those with physical disabilities, as long as they meet the other eligibility criteria (age, income, and residency).\n\nCan I apply for the scheme directly online without visiting the CSC?\n\nCurrently, no. Applying for the scheme requires visiting the nearest Common Service Center (CSC). They will assist you with the application process, including biometric verification and document upload.\n\nI live in a remote area and have limited access to the internet.

They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf, even if you don't have internet access at home.\n\nI lost my Destitute Certificate.

However, it will be a basic model suitable for tailoring purposes.\n\nDo I need to return the sewing machine if I decide not to pursue tailoring?\n\nYes, the sewing machine is provided with the expectation that you will use it for self-employment purposes. If you decide not to pursue tailoring, you might need to return the machine to the authorities.\n\nI am a transgender woman who wants to learn tailoring.

You can inquire with the CSC staff for details.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/sanfsosms#sources)\n\n[Citizen's Charter](https://cms.tn.gov.in/sites/default/files/documents/swwe_e_cc_2022_23.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

Good Samaritan Law protects Good Samaritans from harassment on the actions being taken by them to save the life of the road accident victims.\n\nWhy The Need For Good Samaritan Law?\n\nIndia is an unfortunate victim of a large number of road crash fatalities. Three out of four people in the country are hesitant to help injured accident victims on roads due to fear of police harassment, detention at hospitals, and prolonged legal formalities. Even if someone wants to help, these factors stop them from doing so.\n\nHow Did India Get A Good Samaritan Law?\n\nIn the last ten years, road crashes have killed over 13 lakh people in India. According to the Law Commission of India, 50% of these victims died of preventable injuries and could have been saved if they had received care on time. The role of the bystander is critical in providing emergency care to the victim. Yet, in India, bystanders have been hesitant to help the injured for fear of legal repercussions and procedural hassles. In 2012, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court of India, requesting the Hon'ble court to safeguard Good Samaritans who come forward to help the injured.\n\nWhat is the Award For Each Good Samaritan?\n\nThe amount of award for each Good Samaritan would be \u20b9 5,000/- per incident.\n\nTill when shall this scheme Remain Operational?\n\nThe scheme will remain operational till the completion of the 15th Financial Cycle, i.e. till 31st March 2026.\n\nWhat is the Objective Of The Good Samaritan Scheme?\n\nThe objective of the scheme is to motivate the general public to help road accident victims in emergency situations and inspire and motivate others to save innocent lives..\n\nWill the Good Samaritan be Subjected To Any Further Requirements By The Police?\n\nA Good Samaritan who has informed the police of any accident involving a motor vehicle, or who has transported a victim of an accident involving a motor vehicle to the hospital, shall not be subjected to any further requirements by the police or the hospital and shall be permitted to leave immediately.\n\nHow many National Level Awards are granted each year For The Most Worthy Good Samaritans?\n\nThere will be 10 National Level Awards for the most worthy Good Samaritans (who will be selected from all those who have been awarded during the whole year) and they would be given an Award of \u20b9 1,00,000/- each.\n\nHow many times can a Good Samaritan be awarded?\n\nAn individual Good Samaritan can be awarded a maximum of 5 times a year.\n\nWill the Good Samaritan receive a \"Certification of Appreciation\"?\n\nYes, every cash award would be accompanied by a \"Certification of Appreciation\".\n\nWhat if More Than One Good Samaritan Saves The Life Of More Than One Victim?\n\nIf more than one Good Samaritan saves the life of more than one victim of a fatal accident involving a motor vehicle, the amount of award will be \u20b9 5000/- per victim saved subject to a maximum of \u20b9 5000/-per Good Samaritan.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/sgs#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://morth.gov.in/sites/default/files/circulars_document/Scheme_for_grant_of_awards_to_Goods_Samaritan_0001.pdf)\n\n[THE MOTOR VEHICLES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2019 NO. 32 OF 2019](https://morth.nic.in/sites/default/files/notifications_document/MV%20Act%20English.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

However, applicants may apply for more than one activity in a single application, depending on their eligibility.\n\nAre there any specific fees associated with the application process, and are there exemptions for certain categories of applicants?\n\nYes, an application fee of Rs. 100/- (plus GST) is applicable for all applicants, except for those in the SC, ST, female, and differently-abled categories. These exempted stakeholders do not need to pay the application fee.\n\nWhat are the two application modes available for this scheme, and under what circumstances is physical submission of applications accepted?\n\nThe two application modes are offline and online. Initially, the scheme allows for physical submission of applications at field offices (ZO/ROs/SROs/HQ) if the online platform is not yet ready for use. The Competent Authority may accept physical submissions until the online platform becomes operational.\n\nCould you explain the mode of payment for the scheme's subsidies? What electronic payment methods are employed?\n\nAll subsidy payments under the scheme are made through electronic modes, which include RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement), NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), and PFMS (Public Financial Management System).\n\nWhat are the specific exclusions mentioned in the scheme, particularly regarding the ownership of tea gardens?\n\nExclusions are in place to prevent misuse. In the event of a change in ownership of a tea garden before the completion of the subsidy disbursement, the previous owner will cease to receive any further subsidy payments after the transfer or sale is completed.\n\nHow does the scheme define the eligibility criteria for applicants, particularly small tea growers, including members of self-help groups and Farmers' Producer Organizations?\n\nEligible applicants include small tea growers who are members of self-help groups or Farmers' Producer Organizations, provided they have Tea Board registration or an identity smart card issued by the Tea Board. The identity card serves as a unique identification number for eligibility verification.\n\nWhat are the ceiling limits and eligibility criteria for small tea growers to obtain equipment like the Pruning Machine and Mechanical Harvester under the PDSTG component?\n\nSmall tea growers are eligible for equipment under the PDSTG component. The ceiling limit for a Pruning Machine is \u20b930,000, and one machine is allowed for each or up to 5.00 hectares of tea area. For the Mechanical Harvester, the ceiling limit is \u20b925,000 for a Single Man Harvester and \u20b940,000 for a Double Man Harvester. Eligibility for the Mechanical Harvester is for each or up to 10.00 hectares of tea area.\n\nCould you elaborate on the specific components of the TDPS and how they contribute to the Indian tea industry's growth and sustainability?\n\nHe TDPS comprises seven major components, each serving distinct purposes within the Indian tea industry. These components are designed to protect, grow, and sustain the industry. One such component is \"Plantation Development for Small Tea Growers (PDSTG),\" which aims to boost the production and quality of tea and help small growers move up the value chain. Sustainability is addressed through the promotion of organic and climate-resilient tea. Another component focuses on the mechanization for individual small growers.\n\nCould you explain what \"Self-declaration under PPC compliance\" entails and why it's a part of the required documents?\n\nSelf-declaration under PPC compliance refers to an assurance by the applicant that they are compliant with all relevant laws and regulations, particularly those related to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. It serves as a declaration of adherence to food safety standards in tea production.\n\nAre there any specific requirements for the survey map of the tea area, particularly in terms of who can certify it and how it should be prepared?\n\nThe scheme requires a survey map of the tea area, preferably A-4 size, to be drawn by a government-approved surveyor or the Land Revenue department. The map should be duly certified and signed by both the issuing authority and the applicant, where applicable. This ensures the accuracy and authenticity of the map.\n\nHow does the scheme define the concept of \"organic tea cultivation\" in the context of the PDSTG component, and what practices are encouraged?\n\nOrganic tea cultivation refers to the cultivation of tea without the use of synthetic chemicals or pesticides. The PDSTG component encourages practices such as using organic fertilizers, practicing integrated pest management, and promoting sustainability in tea cultivation to ensure the tea is free from harmful chemicals.\n\nCould you explain the significance of mechanization for individual small tea growers within the PDSTG component? How does it benefit these growers?\n\nMechanization is a critical aspect of the PDSTG component. It provides small tea growers with equipment like pruning machines, mechanical harvesters, power sprayers, brush cutters, and plucking shears. These tools significantly improve efficiency, reduce labor costs, and enhance tea quality, making the entire tea cultivation process more sustainable and profitable.\n\nCan you provide insights into the objectives of the \"Plantation Development for Small Tea Growers (PDSTG)\" component and how it contributes to the growth of small tea growers?\n\nThe PDSTG component aims to enhance the production, productivity, and quality of tea among small tea growers. It promotes their overall development, encourages organic tea cultivation and climate-resilient tea, and assists in setting up their own processing units. This empowers small growers and helps them move up the value chain.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tdpspdstgmisg#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://www.teaboard.gov.in/pdf/Approved_modalitites_Guidelines_pdf4268.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n![Image 13: twitter](https://cdn.myscheme.in/images/logos/twitter.svg)\n\n### Something went wrong.

They will assist you with the application process, including biometric verification and document upload.\n\nI don't have access to a computer or the internet at home. How can I apply?\n\nYou can still apply by visiting the nearest CSC. They have the necessary facilities to complete the application process on your behalf.\n\nWhat happens if I cannot attend the distribution event for the free clothes?\n\nIn most cases, the sarees and dhotis can be collected later from designated distribution centers. However, it's best to check with the CSC or local authorities for specific details and collection timelines.\n\nDo I need to show proof of being destitute during the application process?\n\nYes, you might need to submit documents like income certificates, ration card, or self-declaration stating your financial situation to demonstrate your eligibility.\n\nDo I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the benefits?\n\nNo, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.\n\nI live in a remote area. Are there mobile camps or alternative ways to apply besides visiting the CSC?\n\nYou can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.\n\nI recently turned 60 and am unsure about the application process. Can someone help me?\n\nYes, you can bring a trusted family member or friend to the CSC for assistance with the application process. You can also seek help from local community leaders or volunteers who might be familiar with the scheme.\n\nCan I choose the color or design of the free dhoti or saree?\n\nNo, the scheme typically provides pre-selected colors and designs for the free clothes distributed during Pongal and Deepavali.\n\nI am physically unable to collect the free rice from the Anganwadi center. Can someone else collect it on my behalf?\n\nYes, you can authorize a family member or trusted individual to collect the rice on your behalf. You might need to complete an authorization form provided by the Anganwadi center.\n\nIs the pension amount credited directly to my bank account, or can I receive it another way?\n\nThe pension is typically deposited directly into your bank account. You'll provide your bank details during the application process. However, you can inquire with the CSC staff about the possibility of receiving the pension in cash at designated centers, subject to availability and approval.\n\nCan I choose a specific collection date for the free rice?\n\nNo, the Anganwadi centers typically have designated distribution days and timings. You can inquire about the schedule at your nearest center.\n\nIs there a limit on how long I can receive the benefits under this scheme?\n\nNo, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria, you can continue receiving the pension, free clothes, and rice throughout your eligibility period.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ignoapstn#sources)\n\n[Citizen's Charter](https://cms.tn.gov.in/sites/default/files/documents/swwe_e_cc_2022_23.pdf)\n\n[Documents Required](https://tnlegalservices.tn.gov.in/swwe/Annexure_English.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.
