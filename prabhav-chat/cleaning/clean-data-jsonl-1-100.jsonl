They can use these for constructing houses and community halls for both recreation and work purposes. Further, through the amount availed under this scheme, fishermen can install tube wells.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Objectives-**\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.  Provide fishermen with basic amenities such as housing, community halls, tube well for drinking water.\n2.  Ensure Financial And Social Securities Of Fishermen And Their Families.\n3.  Upgrade The Standard Of Living Of Fishermen.\n4.  Educate And Train Fishermen In Advanced Technical Technologies So That They Can Learn Scientific Ways Of Fishing.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/nswf#benefits)\n\nHere are the features and benefits that this government scheme for fishermen offers -\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Housing Facility**\n\nThe National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen offers fishermen facilities for constructing houses. There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed \u20b975,000.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Construction of Common Facility**\n\nThis government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within \u20b92 lakh. Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Assurance of Clean Drinking Water**\n\nThis scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Insurance Facility**\n\n(For Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen)- This scheme provides fisherfolk or licensed or identified or registered with the States or Union Territory \u20b950,000 in case of death or permanent total disability. Also, this scheme provides \u20b925,000 for partial permanent disability.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHere, the insurance cover will continue for 12 months, and FISHCOPFED would take out a policy. Also, under this scheme, the affected fishermen will have to pay an annual premium worth \u20b915 (per head). Here, the Central Government will pay 50%, and the State Government will pay the remaining 50% subsidy as grants-in-aid. In the case of Union Territories, the Central Government will bear a 100% premium.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOn the other hand, those States/UT\u2019s, which subscribed to this Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen through FISHCOPFED, will get a Central share of assistance (100% premium for Union Territories) directly through FISHCOPFED and not through States/UT\u2019s.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Saving cum relief**\n\nThe National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen further offers a savings cum relief scheme. This scheme component collects \u20b975 from marine fishermen for 8 months in a year. Total \u20b9600 needs to be collected to match an equal amount worth \u20b9600 provided by the State and Central Government to segregate on a 50:50 basis. If any fishermen fail to make payment, the authorities will refund the paid amount with interest at the end of the 4th month. Also, the \u2018lean months\u2019 provisions vary from a coastal area or marine area, which FISHCOPFED decides entirely.\n\n\ufeff\n\nNow that individuals know about this government scheme for fishermen, i.e. the National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen, they avail funds and construct houses of their own.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/nswf#eligibility)\n\n**Eligibility Criteria for Inland Fishermen**\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.

The number of such grants was meager and did not serve the intended purpose. Further, the method of selection of candidates and that of disbursements is cumbersome and time-consuming. In order to do away with these predicaments inherent in the scheme and to provide quality assistance to Schedule Caste (SC) students of Classes V to VIII in a smooth, transparent, and efficient way, a new scheme of providing assistance to the target group is being formulated in the name of \"Shikshashree Scheme\".\n\nThe \"Shikshashree Scheme\" scheme of providing assistance to SC day scholars of Class V-VIII is evolved by merging the existing schemes of Book Grants and Maintenance Grants. It is applicable to the day scholars of West Bengal reading in class V-VIII in any Government, Government-aided and all Government recognized schools of West Bengal.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   To provide financial assistance to the SC students reading in classes V to VIII to improve their participation in Pre-matric stages and minimize the incidence of drop-out especially in the case of girl students.\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ss-west-bengal#benefits)\n\n1\\.

The number of such grants was meager and did not serve the intended purpose. Further, the method of selection of candidates and that of disbursements is cumbersome and time-consuming. In order to do away with these predicaments inherent in the scheme and to provide quality assistance to Schedule Caste (SC) students of Classes V to VIII in a smooth, transparent, and efficient way, a new scheme of providing assistance to the target group is being formulated in the name of \"Shikshashree Scheme\".\n\nThe \"Shikshashree Scheme\" scheme of providing assistance to SC day scholars of Class V-VIII is evolved by merging the existing schemes of Book Grants and Maintenance Grants. It is applicable to the day scholars of West Bengal reading in class V-VIII in any Government, Government-aided and all Government recognized schools of West Bengal.\n\n**Objective:**\n\n*   To provide financial assistance to the SC students reading in classes V to VIII to improve their participation in Pre-matric stages and minimize the incidence of drop-out especially in the case of girl students.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 09/07/2024 | v-2.1.8\n"}]}}

Can I apply for the scheme now?\n\nNo, unfortunately, the minimum age requirement to apply for the scheme is 60 years old. You can apply once you reach that age.\n\nI am not completely destitute, but I have very low income from farming. Am I eligible for the scheme?\n\nWhile the scheme prioritizes destitute individuals, having some income from farming wouldn't necessarily disqualify you. However, your income level and overall financial situation will be assessed during the application process to determine your eligibility.\n\nI used to be a farmer, but now I work as a security guard. Am I still eligible for the pension?\n\nNo, the scheme is specifically for farmers and landless agricultural laborers. If your primary source of income is no longer related to agriculture, you wouldn't be eligible.\n\nWhat happens to the free clothes (dhoti/saree) if I cannot attend the distribution event?\n\nIn most cases, the clothes can be collected later from designated distribution centers. However, it's best to check with the CSC or local authorities for specific details and collection timelines.\n\nI am a female farmer. Do I need to show my land ownership documents to apply?\n\nNo, the scheme doesn't differentiate between male and female farmers or require land ownership documents. As long as you have a valid CMPUT membership card and meet the eligibility criteria, you can apply.\n\nDo I need to renew my application every year to continue receiving the benefits?\n\nNo, once approved, you don't need to reapply every year. However, you might need to update your information periodically, as instructed by the authorities.\n\nI live in a remote area with limited access to CSCs. Are there any alternative ways to apply?\n\nYou can inquire with the Social Welfare Department about potential mobile camps or designated application centers closer to your location.\n\nDo I need help from a lawyer or any other professional to complete the application process?\n\nNo, the application process for the Old Age Pension Scheme is designed to be simple and self-explanatory. The CSC staff can also guide you through the process and answer any questions you might have.\n\nIs there a fee associated with applying for the scheme?\n\nNo, applying for the Old Age Pension Scheme is completely free. You shouldn't pay any fees at the CSC or to any individual for processing your application.\n\nHow long does it take to process the application and receive the benefits?\n\nProcessing times can vary, but it typically takes around 4-6 weeks for verification and approval. Once approved, you should receive the pension within a month.\n\nIs there a specific time frame during which I can apply for the scheme?\n\nNo, the Old Age Pension Scheme is an ongoing initiative, and you can apply at any time.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/oapsucmupt#sources)\n\n[Citizen's Charter](https://cms.tn.gov.in/sites/default/files/documents/swwe_e_cc_2022_23.pdf)\n\n[Documents Required](https://tnlegalservices.tn.gov.in/swwe/Annexure_English.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.
