PMAY-G aims at providing a pucca house, with basic amenities, to all houseless households and those households living in kutcha and dilapidated house. PMAY-G addresses the rural housing shortage and bridges the housing deficit in rural areas of India, contributing significantly to the mission of \"Housing for All\". The minimum size of the houses under PMAY-G is 25 sq m including a dedicated area for hygienic cooking. As of 27th Sept 2022, 2.00 crore houses have been constructed out of the total target of 2.72 crores. The beneficiaries are identified using the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) parameters and verified by the Gram Sabhas. The amount is transferred directly to the Aadhaar-Linked Bank Account / Post-Office Account of the beneficiary. PMAY-G has been extended for another two years, i.e. till 31st March 2024.\n\n> **Aim and Objective:**\n\nPMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2024. The immediate objective is to cover 1.00 Crore households in rural areas, that are houseless or living in kutcha / dilapidated house, in three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 and enable construction of quality houses by the beneficiaries using local materials, designs and trained masons. For houses to become homes, adoption of a habitat approach through convergence is proposed.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmay-g#benefits)\n\n1.  Financial Assistance of \u20b9 1,20,000 per unit for plain areas; and \u20b9 1,30,000 per unit for hilly areas, difficult areas, and IAP districts (Himalayan states, North-Eastern states, and Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir).\n2.  A willing beneficiary can avail of institutional finance (loan) of up to \u20b9 70,000 at 3% lower interest rate, to build a permanent house. The maximum principal amount for which subsidy can be sought is \u20b9 2,00,000.\n3.  The minimum size of the house shall be is 25 sq m including a dedicated area for hygienic cooking.\n4.  In convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G), the beneficiaries get financial assistance of up to \u20b9 12,000 for the construction of toilets.\n5.  In convergence with MGNREGA, the beneficiary is entitled to employment as unskilled labor (Rural Mason Training) at \u20b9 90.95 per day for 95 days.\n6.  In convergence with Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, one LPG connection per house is provided.\n7.  Convergence with different government programmes for piped drinking water, electricity connection, clean & efficient cooking fuel, treatment of social and liquid waste, etc.\n8.  Payments are made electronically directly to bank accounts or post office accounts that are linked to Aadhaar.\n\n**Note:** Beneficiaries are identified using the \"Housing Deprivation Parameters\" from the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 \\[[https://secc.gov.in/\\]](https://secc.gov.in/), further verified by the Gram Sabhas.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmay-g#eligibility)\n\nThe universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).\n\n> **Criteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion -**\n\n1\\. Households without shelter\n\n2\\. Destitute/ living on alms\n\n3\\. Manual scavengers\n\n4\\. Primitive Tribal Groups\n\n5\\. Legally released bonded laborer\n\n> **Prioritisation within the Universe**\n\ni. There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others.\n\nii. To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order.\n\niii. In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\n\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores.\n\nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\n\ni. Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\n\nii. Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\n\niii. Households with no literate adult above 25 years\n\niv. Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\n\nv. Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\n\nvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\n\n**Note:** _To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas._\n\n> _**Earmarking of Targets -**_\n\n**For SC/ST:**\n\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\n\n**For Minorities:**\n\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\n\n**For PwDs:**\n\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\n\n> **Tie Breaker**\n\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\n\ni. Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\n\nii. Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\n\niii. Households with a single girl child.\n\niv. Beneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act.\n\nv. Transgender persons.\n\n[### Exclusions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmay-g#exclusions)\n\n> **Step 1: Exclusion of pucca houses**\n\nAll households living in houses with pucca roofs and/or pucca walls and households living in houses with more than 2 rooms are filtered out.\n\n> **Step 2: Automatic Exclusion**\n\nFrom the remaining set of households, all households fulfilling any one of the 13 parameters listed below are automatically excluded:-\n\n1\\. Motorised two/three/four wheeler/ fishing boat\n\n2\\. Mechanised three/four-wheeler agricultural equipment\n\n3\\. Kisan Credit Card with a credit limit of Rs.50,000 or above\n\n4\\.

In cases where the applicant is not from a Scheduled Tribe family but the deceased individual is, the applicant can still claim assistance under the scheme. However, to be eligible, the applicant must establish a direct relationship with the deceased person. This claim should be made within 12 months from the occurrence of the death within the kin's family.\n\nWho is eligible to apply for the benefits of the \"Antya Sanskar Sahay Yojana\"?\n\nThe scheme is open to Scheduled Tribe families. The eligibility criteria specify that either the deceased individual or the applicant seeking assistance must belong to a Scheduled Tribe family. Additionally, the family's annual income should not exceed \u20b9 3,00,000.\n\nWhat is the primary objective of the \"Antya Sanskar Sahay Yojana\" launched by the Department of Tribal Welfare in Goa?\n\nThe main objective of the \"Antya Sanskar Sahay Yojana\" is to provide financial support to Scheduled Tribe families in covering the expenses associated with the funeral and religious ceremonies of deceased family members.\n\nHow does the scheme address cases where the applicant seeking assistance is not from a Scheduled Tribe family, but the deceased person is?\n\nIn such scenarios, the applicant can still apply for assistance, provided they establish a direct relationship with the deceased. This ensures that eligible individuals, even if not from a Scheduled Tribe background, can access the benefits if they can prove their relationship with the deceased.\n\nWhat are the documents required to prove the annual income eligibility criterion?\n\nTo establish that the annual family income does not exceed \u20b9 3,00,000, applicants need to submit an Income Certificate issued by the Competent Authority. This certificate verifies their income status and ensures compliance with the scheme's income threshold.\n\nHow does the scheme determine the actual cost of funeral and religious ceremonies?\n\nThe scheme allows financial assistance of up to \u20b9 20,000 or the actual cost, whichever is less. The \"Vouchers Receipts\" document is significant here, as it serves as a record of expenses incurred during the ceremonies, enabling accurate calculation of assistance based on actual costs.\n\nCan you provide insights into the \"Sanctioning Authority\" and the decision-making process within the scheme?\n\nThe Director of Tribal Welfare scrutinizes the applications in the prescribed manner. Approved applications are then sanctioned by the Directorate of Tribal Welfare, and the sanctioned benefits are electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Any difficulties in implementation are resolved by a state-level committee, ensuring transparency and fair decision-making.\n\nCan you explain the significance of the \"Mandate Form\" among the required documents?\n\nThe \"Mandate Form\" is essential as it provides the necessary authorization for the financial assistance to be transferred to the beneficiary's bank account. This ensures a seamless and secure transfer process, allowing beneficiaries to receive the sanctioned amount promptly.\n"}]}}

Officers of the other two All India Services, viz., IPS and IFoS, and those of other organized Group \\`A\u2019 Central Civil Services are eligible under the Scheme only when they are holding posts on deputation under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\nWhere can I find the Circular giving the terms and conditions along with the eligibility criteria for applying under the Scheme?\n\nThe circular is issued every year and hosted on the website of this Ministry (www.persmin.nic.in)\n\nHow and when can I apply under the Scheme?\n\nThe circular for training programmes to be conducted in a financial year (April to March) is generally issued in the month of October of the preceding year, e.g., for training programmes to be offered in FY 2011\u201012, the circular was issued in October 2010. The circular also contains an application form for filling up by interested officers.\n\nIs there a common Circular for the Long term as well as the Short term Programmes?\n\nYes\n\nWhich are the areas for Long term and short term programmes sponsored under the DFFT Scheme?\n\nThe long\u2010term programmes are mainly in the fields of public policy, public management, public administration, etc. while the themes for the short\u2010term programmes are leadership, executive development, fiscal decentralization, tax analysis & revenue forecasting, project management, corruption & anti\u2010corruption, health sector reforms, public administration, public finance management, infrastructure, and PPP, training of trainers, and advance competencies for trainers, environmental policy issues, etc. The specific programmes both Long Term and short term are included in the Circular issued each year.\n\nHow are the selections made?\n\nIt is mandatory to apply \\`online\u2019 for the training programmes under the DFFT scheme. A software\u2010based eligibility list is generated, followed by a merit list. Based on the date available through these lists, a duly constituted Committee recommends officers for long\u2010term and short\u2010term training programmes taking into account the relevance and suitability factors and takes approval of the competent authority.\n\nWho bears the cost of the programme and what are the entitlements for living/daily allowances and accommodation allowance?\n\nThe entire cost of the participation of officers in training programmes under the DFFT scheme is met by the Training Division, except for certain pre\u2010departure expenses. A detailed circular dated 19th January 2011 indicating various entitlements is available on the Ministry\u2019s website (www.persmin.nic.in).\n\nIs the air travel also arranged by the DOPT? If so,how do we get the air tickets ?\n\nYes, the travel in the entitled class (on an excursion fare basis) is arranged through Air India by the DOPT. For this purpose, vouchers are issued to the Air India office at Safdarjung Airport. The name and contact details of the concerned officers in Air India are intimated to the nominated officers who then get in touch with them and reserve tickets to their respective destinations.\n\nDoes nomination by DoPT guarantee admission to the programmes?\n\nNot necessarily. The concerned institutes also have their own selection procedures which may sometimes reject the nominations made by DOPT.\n\nWhen I can apply for the support under the Partial Funding Scheme?\n\nThe applications can be made throughout the year but only after securing admission to the chosen programme/ University. However, the period from April to June is ideal as most of the programmes commence in August/September.\n\nIf I fulfil all the eligibility criteria as per the Circular can I be sure to get the Partial Funding support from the DoPT?\n\nDOPT administers the partial funding scheme. However, the Central Establishment Board is the final authority in the matter which may lay down its own criteria such as public interest, budget, etc. while deciding the cases of partial funding.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/dfft-scheme#sources)\n\n[Official Website](https://dopt.gov.in/schemes/domestic-funding-foreign-training-dfft)\n\n[DFFT Portal](https://dfft.nic.in/Start1.aspx)\n\n[Application Process-User Guide](https://dfft.nic.in/ManualDFFT.pdf)\n\n[FAQs](https://dopt.gov.in/sites/default/files/Dfft_FAQs.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

The scheme provides funding support (through fellowship and research grant), technical and business mentoring, exposure to bio incubation model, orientation to an entrepreneurial culture, etc. to students at various levels including undergraduates, post-graduates, and post-doctoral.\n\n> **E-YUVA Centers (EYCs):**\n\nThe BIRAC\u2019s E-YUVA scheme is implemented through dedicated hubs called \u201cE-YUVA Centers (EYCs)\u201d housed within the University/Institute set up and mentored by a BIRAC BioNEST-supported bio-incubator. EYCs act as anchors and extend requisite support and mentoring to students. Each EYC has a BIRAC-supported pre-incubation space which offers infrastructure and equipment for basic research and experimentation by selected students. Advanced research needs are fulfilled through Bio-incubator Connect.\n\n**BIRAC-supported EYCs encompass the following:**\n\n*   Pre-incubation space (3,000 sq. ft. or more)\n*   Manage Fellowships for students\n*   Conduct Entrepreneurial Awareness Workshops for students\n\n**Roles and Responsibilities of EYCs:**\n\n*   View and process online applications received for fellowship\n*   Screen applications for eligibility and suitability for the scheme\n*   Carry out online Technical Review of eligible applications through Subject Experts (Reviewers)\n*   Shortlist proposals for interview(F2F/skype/telephonic) by an Expert Panel\n*   Communicate decision to applicants at each step of selection\n*   Seek BIRAC approval on the final selection of fellows or their eligibility\n*   Issue fellowship award letters to the selected candidates on behalf of BIRAC\n*   Release fellowship and research grant received from BIRAC\n*   Provide mentorship, handholding, and access to facilities at EYC and EYC Knowledge Partner for BIRAC\u2019s Innovation and E-YUVA Fellows\n*   Monitor the targeted milestones\n*   Organize periodic review meetings\n*   Provide mentorship and handholding for domain expertise, entrepreneurship, and activities including but not limited to IP management, mobilizing resources, and other business development-related activities\n*   Provide platforms/opportunities for interaction with experts.\n*   Provide periodic updates and reports on the progress of Fellows to BIRAC\n*   Conduct entrepreneurial workshops\n*   Any other activity required for effective implementation of fellowships on mutual consent with BIRAC.\n\n> **Tenure of EY Centres:**\n\nEYCs will be engaged for an initial duration of 3 years, extendable further based on performance review. The performance of the EYCs would be evaluated annually.\n\n> **E-Yuva Knowledge Partner:**\n\nFor the mentoring of Innovation Fellows and for providing overall guidance to EYCs, BIRAC will assign engagement with BioNEST-supported Bio-incubators. Each EYC will be formally associated with a BioNEST-supported bio incubator, which shall provide necessary handholding and mentoring to EYCs and Innovation Fellows. The knowledge partner will engage with the fellows throughout the award period and provide overall guidance. Bio-incubators will act as brand ambassadors for the program and will help in its outreach.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/e-yuvase-yuvac#benefits)\n\n**Financial Support to each EYC:**\n\n**A.

The program provides subsidized seedlings to farmers for planting on their lands. Farmers are paid an incentive of Rs 35 for every surviving seedling at the end of the first year, Rs 40 after the completion of the second year, and Rs 50 after the completion of the third year. This is done to encourage the farmers to nurture the seedlings for at least three years.\n\nThe amount of money provided as an incentive (Rs 125/- per seedling) more than compensates the cost incurred by the farmer in procuring and planting the seedling. The incentive is quite substantial when the farmer plants more seedlings. In addition to the financial incentive, the farmers are entitled to get handsome returns from the grown-up trees in the form of fruits, seeds, fodder, firewood, pole, timber, and other useful products.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/kapy#benefits)\n\n1.

Encourages nurturing: The incentive is given to encourage the farmer not only to plant the seedlings but also to nurture them at least for three years.\n5.  Compensates cost: The total amount of money provided (Rs 125/- per seedling) more than compensates the cost incurred by the farmer in procuring and planting the seedling.\n6.

In case, a Satyagrahi has already passed away, the monthly pension will be given to his/her surviving spouse.\n\nIn the year 1957, a number of people from Hindi-speaking parts of erstwhile Punjab launched a crusade for the honour, promotion, and implementation of their mother tongue.

The Deputy Commissioners, being the chairpersons of the committee, had got the record of Matribhasha Satyagrahis verified by the concerned Superintendents of Police by checking/verifying their record from the jails.\n\n*   The Administrative Secretary of Information, Public Relations & Languages Department, Haryana will be competent to accord sanctions under this scheme.\n*   The expenditure under this scheme will be borne by the Information, Public Relations & Languages Department, Haryana. After sanction by the Administrative Secretary of this department, the amount of pension will be deposited in the bank account of beneficiary Satyagrahi.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/msps#benefits)\n\n1\\.

During this time, interest will accrue on the loan, but no penal interest will be charged. This period allows borrowers to adjust financially before beginning their regular equated monthly installments (EMIs).\n\nCan I Repay The Loan Before The End Of The Moratorium Period\n\nYes, you have the option to repay the loan immediately after the disbursement of the first installment, even before the end of the moratorium period. This can help you save on interest costs and shorten the overall loan tenure.\n\nHow Is The Loan Repayment Period Determined For Applicants Above 50 Years Of Age\n\nIf you are above 50 years of age, the repayment period for the loan will be extended until you reach 60 years of age. This extension takes into consideration your age and provides you with a suitable repayment timeframe.\n\nWhat Happens If I'm Employed By A Government Entity And Plan To Retire During The Loan Repayment Period\n\nIf you are an employee of State/Central Government/Government Corporation/Board or an aided Institute and you plan to retire during the loan repayment period, your repayment period will be re-fixed. It will be extended until your retirement age, plus an additional six months from the date of retirement. This ensures that your loan repayment aligns with your retirement plans.\n\nWhat Is The Penalty For Defaulting On An EMI Repayment\n\nIn case of default in repaying any installment, an interest rate of 2% will be charged on the overdue installment amount. It's important to stick to the repayment schedule to avoid accruing additional costs due to default.\n\nCan I Transfer My Loan To Another Financial Institution For House Reconstruction During The Repayment Period\n\nYes, you can transfer your loan to another financial institution for house reconstruction. However, in this case, you will need to repay the outstanding loan balance to the Corporation in one lump sum. Once the loan is fully repaid, you will be issued a no-due certificate to facilitate the loan transfer.\n\nWhat Happens If I'm Unable To Repay The Loan As Per The Schedule\n\nIf the loan is not repaid as per the scheduled scheme, the Corporation will initiate recovery proceedings as arrears under the Goa Daman and Diu Land Revenue Code. It's essential to communicate with the Corporation in case of financial difficulties to explore possible solutions.\n\nWho Has The Authority To Sanction Loans Under The Ashraya Adhar Scheme\n\nThe Chairman of the Corporation, along with any two Directors, will approve the loan applications under the scheme. Following this approval, the Managing Director of the Corporation will officially sanction the loan.\n\nIs There A Provision To Modify The Scheme If Needed\n\nYes, the scheme can be modified to address new challenges or requirements that may arise. The scheme will be implemented for five years from the date of issue, and if necessary, it may be adjusted to better achieve its objectives.\n\nWhat If I Provide Incorrect Or Fraudulent Information To Avail Benefits Under The Scheme\n\nProviding false or fraudulent information can result in criminal breach of trust. It's important to provide accurate and truthful details to avoid legal consequences.\n\nCan I Prepay A Portion Of My Loan During The Repayment Period\n\nYes, partial prepayment of the loan is generally allowed. However, you should check with the Corporation for their specific policies on partial prepayment.

Changes might be considered based on your circumstances and the Corporation's policies.\n\nAre There Any Tax Benefits Associated With This Loan Repayment\n\nTax benefits might be available based on local regulations and the purpose of the loan.

Registered Karkhanas/Karkhandars are identified who are willing to enroll a batch of trainees and ex-trainees in their Karkhana. A minimum of five trainees for a small Karkhana and a maximum of 10 trainees for a big Karkhana. A minimum of one and a maximum of five training programs per craft shall be considered for the six-month duration of the training program.\n\n\ufeff\n\n> **Objectives of the Scheme:**\n\n1\\. Revive the languishing crafts.\n\n2\\. Upscale the learning techniques of trainees.\n\n3\\. Improve the wage earnings of the craftsmen by leading them into collectivization\n\n4\\. Create linkages with producer organizations to inculcate entrepreneurship skills and aptitude in the trainees.\n\n\ufeff\n\n> **Vision of the scheme:**\n\nThe artisans who form the backbone of the craft sector work in an exploitative chain of business leading them to a vicious cycle of poverty and pessimism. A huge number of artisans (mostly the male folk) are forced to abandon the craft activity due to low wage earnings and poor socio-economic status. It is felt that this scheme shall emerge as one of the most effective pathways to address the challenges being faced by the artisan community. Exposing the pass-out trainees to improved productivity procedures adopted by producer groups can lead them to better productivity and leverage their collective skill up-gradation which can help in promoting sustainable livelihoods as the artisans can gain direct access to customized production, new design development, technology-related modifications, and above all can have the pulse of market demands.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

Only DPIIT recognized startups can apply for the SISFS.\n\nDoes the scheme support startups from specific sectors?\n\nSISFS is a sector agnostic scheme, which means that startups from any sector can apply for the scheme. However, preference would be given to startups creating innovative solutions in sectors such as social impact, waste management, water management, financial inclusion, education, agriculture, food processing, biotechnology, healthcare, energy, mobility, defense, space, railways, oil and gas, textiles, etc. This list of sectors is indicative and not exhaustive.\n\nAre there any minimum education qualification criteria for founders to apply for SISFS?\n\nThere is no minimum education qualification required for founders to apply for SISFS.\n\nAre there any exemptions to any of the eligibility criteria?\n\nNo, there are no exemptions to any of the eligibility criteria.

It also aims to give startups an opportunity to get supported by a relevant incubator that can give the necessary guidance to them. Thus, we give startups an option to apply to 3 different incubators according to their preference. For example, if incubators at Preference 1 and Preference 2 both select a startup, the funding shall be given by Preference 1 incubator. If Preference 1 incubator rejects and Preference 2 incubator selects, the funding shall be given by incubator at Preference 2, and so on.\n\nHow do I choose the incubators to apply to?\n\nThe incubator preference should be filled at the startup applicants\u2019 discretion.

Details of the incubators which are part of the scheme will be available on Seed Fund Portal soon.\n\nIs the information provided by me in the application form kept confidential?\n\nWe maintain confidentiality of all the proposals we receive under the scheme. Your application is only shared with the incubators you apply to for the purpose of evaluation, and with the EAC for the purpose of monitoring.\n\nDo I need to be physically present at an incubator\u2019s\u2019 premises to avail seed funds under this scheme?\n\nTo apply for the scheme, it is not mandatory to be physically present at the incubator\u2019s location. For startups being monitored virtually by the incubator, it is required for both parties to touch base every 30 days. This is to ensure that an incubator will be able to keep a check on the progress of the startup and a startup will be able to take guidance for their business from the incubator.\n\nCan I apply to the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme again after receiving a rejection?\n\nYes, you can apply to the SISFS again after 3 months of receiving a rejection. This buffer time is given to ensure that you have worked on the feedback received from incubators and are ready to be considered again.\n\nWho is going to review my application?\n\nApplication of each startup will be reviewed by an Incubator Seed Management Committee (ISMC) formed by the incubators you apply to. The committee will also be responsible for future assessment of the performance of the startup and disbursement of further tranches. Each ISMC constitutes of the following members: 1.

The preference order of the incubator cannot be changed at a later stage.\n\nI need to hire a legal or financial consultant for my seed fund discussions with the incubator. Who will bear the cost of these services?\n\nThe startup shall bear the cost of any consultants required to guide them through documentation, negotiations with incubator, signing of agreement with incubator, reporting progress after approval of seed fund, etc. Hiring such an external consultant is not mandatory at all, and shall be at the discretion of the startup.\n\nI have been selected for seed fund. Is it mandatory to sign a legal agreement with the incubator?\n\nYes, it is mandatory to sign a legal agreement with the incubator to avail the seed fund you have been granted.\n\nI had applied for a certain amount of seed fund, but the approved amount is lower/higher. Can I negotiate this?\n\nThe applicant can discuss the quantum of seed fund and the milestones associated with the tranches to be disbursed with the Incubator Seed Management Committee. The decision of the Committee shall be final.\n\nWill my living expenses be borne if I want to be physically incubated at the incubator that is funding me?\n\nThe selected incubator shall provide physical infrastructure to the selected startups for regular functioning, support for testing and validating ideas, mentoring for prototype or product development or commercialization, and developing capacities in finance, human resources, legal compliances, and other functions. They are also expected to provide networking with investors and opportunities for showcasing in various national and international events. Any other expenses, including living expenses, shall be borne by the startup.\n\nHow much time will it take for the first installment of the seed fund to be released to me?\n\nFor grants, the first installment to any selected startup shall be released not more than 60 days from receipt of application from the startup. The startup shall submit the interim progress update and utilization certificate to initiate the release of subsequent installment of grant. For debt or convertible debentures, a similar timeline will be aimed but it is understood that due diligence and documentation in these cases can be sometimes time-consuming.\n\nWhere can I receive the seed funds?\n\nStartups will receive the funds in their company bank accounts.\n\nHow often do I have to report back my progress after receiving seed fund?\n\nEach startup will be required to touch base with the incubator team and share updates with them at least once in 15 days via videoconferences or physical meetings. These updates should be shared on the scheme dashboard at least on a monthly basis. In case of milestone-based disbursements, startup shall submit the interim progress update and utilisation certificate to initiate the release of subsequent installment of grant. Startup shall also submit final report and audited utilisation certificate at the end of the project duration.\n\nI have been selected for seed fund, but I would not like to take the process forward. What do I do?\n\nA startup can choose to not avail the support being offered to them under the scheme. The procedure for the same depends on the stage of the startup in the application process. 1. If the startup has been selected and the seed funding has been approved, they will be required to write a short letter mentioning the reason to pull out of the process. Post the acknowledgment of the letter, they will find a cancel application button on the application tracker tab of their dashboard which will allow them to cancel their application. 2. If the startup has already received any seed fund, it will be required to write a short letter mentioning the reason to pull out of the process. Post acknowledgment of the letter, they will be required to return the fund within 15 days. Post the acknowledgment of refund, they will find a cancel application button on the application tracker tab of their dashboard.\n\nWhat if my startup fails after receiving the seed fund? Will there be any liability on me or my company?\n\nIt is understood that every startup cannot be successful. The legal agreement that you sign with the incubator will have provisions related to failure of startups supported under the scheme. For failed ventures, the entrepreneur shall share his/her learnings and the reasons for failure in the report and submit this along with the utilization certificate for the fund amount.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/sisfs-fs#sources)\n\n[Official Website](https://seedfund.startupindia.gov.in/)\n\n[Startup India Portal](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/)\n\n[DPIIT Website](https://dpiit.gov.in/startup-india/startup-india-initiative)\n\n[Guidelines- English](https://dpiit.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines-FundScheme-Startup-29January2021.pdf)\n\n[Guidelines- Hindi](https://dpiit.gov.in/sites/default/files/guidelines_FundScheme_02September2021_0.pdf)\n\n[Operational Guidelines For Fund Of Funds For Startups](https://dpiit.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines_FFS_07January2022.pdf)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.
