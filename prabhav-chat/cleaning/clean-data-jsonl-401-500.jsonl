Sour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing):** Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.\n\n**2\\. Anti-Hail Net Structure:** Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme \u201cKrishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)\u201d was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna\u201d in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.\n\n**3\\. Green House Renovation Scheme:** Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme\u201d in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d as a component namely Green House Renovation.

Sour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing):** Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.\n\n**2\\. Anti-Hail Net Structure:** Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme \u201cKrishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)\u201d was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna\u201d in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.\n\n**3\\. Green House Renovation Scheme:** Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme \u201cMukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme\u201d in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme \u201cMukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana\u201d as a component namely Green House Renovation. Under this scheme, 70% assistance is being provided to the farmers for the replacement of poly sheets after 5 years of setting up of polyhouse or damage due to natural calamities.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

However, the potentiality of tea tourism has remained unexplored in its actual terms. The tea gardens of Assam with their lush greenery, iconic bungalows, and the tanned ethnic people with their distinct rhythmic music and dance carry potentialities to attract both domestic and international tourist interests and can present a magnificent revenue opportunity to the state. Considering the enormous potentiality of tea tourism in Assam, it is proposed to develop 50 selective Tea Gardens as Tourism destinations in a Mission Mode approach.\n\nThe development of tea tourism in Assam, besides sustaining the environment and preserving the heritage and culture, will benefit the state by creating employment opportunities and boosting the rural economy.\n\nConsidering the huge potentialities of tea tourism in Assam, the Government of Assam launched the scheme \u201cPromotion and Development of Tea Tourism Infrastructure in Assam\u201d which broadly includes the overall experience of tourists in the midst of a tea garden or state, with accommodation facility in an iconic bungalow with modern amenities. The scope of the scheme will include trekking in the natural beauty of a lush tea garden, undertaking a tea-testing session, visiting a modern tea factory and even trying one\u2019s hand at plucking tea leaves, etc. All components to be undertaken under the scheme will be need-based. Moreover, the probable activities under the scheme may be as follows:-\n\na) Renovation of heritage bungalows.\n\nb) Renovation of heritage tea guest houses.\n\nc) Renovation of the front side of the tea garden depicting all modern tea tourism implications.\n\nd) Dining hall/cafeteria with all modern amenities.\n\ne) Development of swimming pool/spa as part of the facility.\n\nf) Facilities including angling, boating, water fountain, etc.\n\ng) Recreation facility/yoga center.\n\nh) Development of golf courses.\n\ni) Installation of solar lights.\n\nj) Involvement of local youths in proposed tea tourism activities to be developed.\n\nk) Facilities like tea testing shall be developed.\n\nl) Any other facility deemed fit to be incorporated for boosting tea tourism.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe assistance or sharing pattern under the scheme is 50:50 (Government\u2019s share: Beneficiary share). The selected Tea Gardens will be the beneficiaries under the scheme, with an upper ceiling of \u20b9 2 Crore as Govt. Share.\n\nMonitoring: The scheme will be implemented by Assam Tourism Development Corporation (ATDC) and monitored by State Level Committee (SLC).\n\nFund Flow: Funds i.e. Government\u2019s share will be released in three installments to the beneficiaries in the following manner:\n\nA. First Instalment: First installment which is 20 % of the eligible subsidy under the scheme will be released on completion of 30% of the total estimated project work based on the progress report to be submitted by the concerned Engineers of implementing agency.\n\nB. Second Instalment: Second installment which is 40 % of the eligible subsidy under the scheme will be released on completion of 70% of the total estimated project work based on the progress report to be submitted by the concerned Engineers of implementing agency.\n\nC. Third and final Instalment: 3rd and final installment i.e. 40% will be released after completion of the approved works and submission of the final progress report, bill, etc. duly certified by the concerned Engineers indicating that the beneficiary tea garden has completed 100% project activities.\n\nFor the release of the Third and final installment, the following documents are to be submitted along with the fund release proposal:\n\n\u2022 Submission of photographs of pre-development, during development, and post-development stage signed by the site engineer.\n\n\u2022 Submission of Geo-tagging records of the project (if applicable).\n\n\u2022 Submission of 100% work completion reports.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

Central Financial Assistance (CFA)\\* to Residential sector \u2022 CFA @ 40% of benchmark cost or @40 % of tendered rates (whichever is lower) for capacity up to 3 kWp \u2022 CFA @ 20% of benchmark cost or 20 % of tendered rates (whichever is lower) for capacity beyond 3 kWp and up to 10 kWp \u2022 CFA @ 20% of benchmark cost or @ 20 of tendered rates (whichever is lower) for GHS/RWA capacity up to 500 kWp (limited to 10 kWp per house and total upto 500 kWp) For calculation of CFA, the PV plant capacity will be inverter capacity or the PV module capacity, whichever is lower. For availing CFA, the PV module and cell shall be manufactured in India only.\n\nWhether residential consumer has to pay the full cost of the system for Residential Sector Subsidised Projects?\n\nNo. Consumer has to pay the balance amount after deducting the subsidy (eligible CFA) from the L1 project cost discovered by the DISCOMs. Advisory on scheme is also available at https://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/file\\_f1610949591054.pdf\n\nHow can i apply for installation of Solar Rooftop System?\n\nResidential consumers and Group Housing Society can apply for installation of solar rooftop system through the online portal of DISCOMs. The link for the online portal of DISCOMs is mentioned- https://solarrooftop.gov.in/grid\\_others/discomPortalLink\n\nWhat is the general procedure for installation of Rooftop Solar System for beneficiary?\n\nThe interested beneficiary may install the solar rooftop systems through project developers/system integrators/manufactures etc. after taking necessary approval from DISCOMs within the capacity limit as laid down in the order of respective State Electricity Regulatory Commission/Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission of the respective States/UTs.\n\nCan I install Rooftop Solar System If I live in a rented house?\n\nThe RTS under any framework like net or gross metering can be installed by the electricity consumer. So, if you have electricity connection in your name and you pay regularly the electricity bill in your own name and also you have the permission of use the roof for solar rooftop installation from the owner, you can install the RTS.\n\nWhat is the minimum warrantee period envisaged under the scheme?\n\nSolar PV modules used in solar power plants /systems must be warranted for their output peak watt capacity, which should not be less than 90% at the end of 12 years and 80% at the end of 25 years. The mechanical structures, electrical works including power conditioners/inverters/charge controllers/maximum power point tracker units/distribution boards/digital meters/switch gear/storage batteries, etc. and overall workmanship of the SPV power plants/ systems must be warranted against any manufacturing/ design/ installation defects for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nWhat targets has the government kept for installation of Rooftop Solar Plants in the country?\n\nGovernment of India has set the target of installing 40,000 MW of Rooftop Solar (RTS) Power by the year 2022. State-wise tentative targets are available in the website link (State-wise-and-year-wise-target-for-installation-of-40000MWp-GCRTsystems\\_0.pdf) )\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/gcrsp-p2#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://solarrooftop.gov.in/notification/145_notification.pdf)\n\n[Official Website](http://solarrooftop.gov.in/)\n\n[Application Process](https://solarrooftop.gov.in/pdf/np_application_process.pdf)\n\n[Statewise List Of DISCOM Portals](https://solarrooftop.gov.in/grid_others/discomPortalLink)\n\n[FAQ](https://solarrooftop.gov.in/pdf/FAQ_np_revised.pdf)\n\n[Grievance Redressal](https://solarrooftop.gov.in/customer/apply/grievanceRedressal)\n\n[Consumer Registration Portal](https://solarrooftop.gov.in/consumerRegistration)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

The scheme's benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls' names, leaving the decision of utilizing the money in their hands.\n\n\ufeff\n\nTo reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behavior change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions, and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAs more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to help them become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social and emotional development will give them a better foundation for their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it is expected that the practice of child marriage will be completely eradicated. Women will attain their right to health, education, and socio-economic equality.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**The main objective of the scheme is to prevent child marriage and promote education among girls. It also aims to improve the health and nutrition of girls and empower them by building their skills and capacities.**\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe scheme is implemented through a network of school teachers, community workers, and government officials. The scheme has been recognized as a best practice in girl-child empowerment by the United Nations.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOverall, the Kanyashree Prakalpa scheme has been successful in promoting the education and well-being of girls in West Bengal and has been replicated in other parts of the country.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/wbkanyashree#benefits)\n\nThe scheme offers two types of benefits - annual scholarships and one-time grants:\n\n\ufeff\n\nAnnual scholarships: Girls who are studying in classes 8 to 12 in government-aided or recognized schools can apply for a yearly scholarship of Rs. 750.
