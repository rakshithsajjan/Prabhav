The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.\n\nThe statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family\u2019s main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused & exploited.\n\nChildren in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.\n\n**Objectives of the Scheme:**\n\n1.  To identify the orphaned children in the community.\n2.  To assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.\n3.  To provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.\n4.  To improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.\n5.  To encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.\n6.  To extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/ss-kerala#benefits)\n\n\ufeff\n\n<table class=\"border border-solid border-gray-300 w-full table-fixed border-collapse\"><tbody data-slate-node=\"element\"><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><strong><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Sl.

The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.\n\nThe statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family\u2019s main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused & exploited.\n\nChildren in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.\n\n**Objectives of the Scheme:**\n\n1.  To identify the orphaned children in the community.\n2.  To assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.\n3.  To provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.\n4.  To improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.\n5.  To encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.\n6.  To extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n![Image 14: twitter](https://cdn.myscheme.in/images/logos/twitter.svg)\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 15: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 16](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 17: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 18: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 23: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 24: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.\n\n\ufeff\n\nIt is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State's flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State's flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State's revenue in substantial quantum.\n\nIt is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/cmfm#benefits)\n\n*   Govt. will provide planting materials, required quantity of shade net and one garden tool kit as Govt. share.\n\n*   The beneficiaries will have to erect the bamboo/steel structure themselves under observation of departmental officers as beneficiary\u2019s share.\n\n*   The cost of bed preparation, fertilizer etc. will have to be borne by the beneficiaries.\n\n*   Departmental officers will provide complete technical support to the beneficiaries.\n*   For the year 2015- 16 cultivation of Gerbera under Shade net house with tissue cultured planting materials is proposed to be taken up covering an area of 200 sqm. per unit area.\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/cmfm#eligibility)\n\n*   The component will be implemented in rural and urban areas.\n*   The beneficiaries should be of small and marginal category.\n*   Women SHGs and unemployed youths should get preference.\n*   The beneficiaries should have their own land in their premises or rented land on long term lease.\n*   Modern cultivation technology will disseminated by the concerning departmental officers through training and skill teaching.\n*   One beneficiary can avail only one unit \u00e9\u203a200 sqm.\n*   Proper representation from SC and ST farmers should be ensured.\n*   Beneficiary selection will be finalized by the District Level Beneficiaries Selection Committee through wide publicity in mass media.\n*   The District Level Beneficiaries Selection Committee will monitor the program time to time and DAO/DNO will report the progress of work to HQ every fortnight.\n\n[### Application Process](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/cmfm#application-process)\n\nOffline\n\nPlease contact to the office of below mentioned for apply the scheme.\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.

It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can facilitate the students and faculty to \u201cengage, explore, experience, express and excel\u201d as desired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in the wake of release of National Educational Policy 2020,\n\n> **Purpose:**\n\n*   The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc. which conventional labs are not able to.\n\n*   The focus will be on training students so that they become imaginative and creative and stay so at the workplaces they join. The whole idea is to transform engineering education with such a Lab in all colleges and for this they must proactively expose all students to the IDEA Lab, organize training sessions for interested students as well as support projects and by providing online learning materials.\n\n> **Proposal:**\n\n*   As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation, mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty, utilization and expansion of facilities, etc.\n*   The alignment of activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge for any proposal.\n*   Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by AICTE.\n\n> **Implementation:**\n\nThe college/ educational campus/ university and industry are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE or even exceed it, in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally requires:\n\n*   An area of 5000 sq. ft.\n*   Should ideally remain open 24x7.\n*   To be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem.\n*   To hold workshops/ trainings, ideation sessions, boot-camps, competitions etc. and participate in similar activities organized by other IDEA Labs/ organizers and also in national/ international events so as to ensure that IDEA Lab is used productively and also extensively.\n*   To maintain the IDEA Lab, keep it well-furnished, take care of security, provide a safe working environment and stock adequate supplies of consumables.\n*   To provide necessary staff and all support facilities and amenities required to operate and maintain the Lab.\n*   To follow the guidelines issued by AICTE in the matter of IDEA Lab and other Government of India rules besides following the enunciated Code of Conduct (as in Annexures) in letter and spirit.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/aiideals#benefits)\n\n**Financial Assistance:**\n\nEstimated project cost per AICTE Lab is \u20b9 1,10,00,000/- non-recurring expenditures (covering the cost of equipment, tools and consumables) of\u20b9 80,00,000/- and recurring expenditures (covering the cost of events and activities for two years) of \u20b9 30,000,00/-. AICTE can provide up to 50% i.e. \u20b9 55,00,000/-.\n\n> **Training to Faculties and Students:**\n\nVarious types of training will be provided to the faculties and the students on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration, etc.\n\n> **Activities to be conducted by an IDEA Lab:**\n\nThe following table lists activities/ events and their number/ frequency in AICTE IDEA Lab and there has to be commitment to conduct minimum numbers, to be eligible for sanctioning of the project.\n\n\ufeff\n\n<table class=\"border border-solid border-gray-300 w-full table-fixed border-collapse\"><tbody data-slate-node=\"element\"><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Sr. No.</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Event &amp; Duration</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Target &amp; Batch size</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Objective &amp; Justification</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Frequency/Numbers</span></span></span></td></tr><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">1.</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">FDP (06 Days)</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Faculty (20)</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Faculty needs to be trained on equipment, to be able to guide students and conduct events- including those from other institutions</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Twice in a year</span></span></span></td></tr><tr class=\" border-b border-gray-300\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">2.</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Skilling Programs (06 Days)</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Students (20-30)</span></span></span></td><td class=\"border-solid border-r last:border-r-0 border-gray-300 p-2 text-sm\" data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\"><span data-slate-leaf=\"true\"><span data-slate-string=\"true\">Training in areas like electrical and electronics fabrication, embedded systems design.

With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc.\n\nFor whom the IDEA Lab is meant?\n\nIDEA Lab is meant for students and faculty of the college/ educational campus/University.\n\nWhich institutions are eligible for applying for AICTE IDEA Lab?\n\nInstitutions (including part of educational campuses or universities) more than 10 years old are eligible for applying and must have at least one course accredited by the NBA.\n\nWhat type of civil infrastructure is required for an IDEA Lab?\n\nIdeally, a built up area of 5000 sq. ft. is required. But the institution must agree to provide a minimum built-up and furnished space of 2000 sq. ft. for the laboratory and an additional 1000 sq. ft. to facilitate activities under IDEA Lab. The installation of equipment has to be done taking into account all safety and environmental concerns.\n\nWhat hardware constitutes an IDEA Lab?\n\nIn order to support do-it-yourself activities and facilitate translation of ideas into prototypes, each IDEA Lab must be equipped with tools, components and consumables. Equipment and consumables have been identified (in Annexure ) and tools (in Annexure I1) which need to be there for a fully functional IDEA Lab as a complete unit.\n\nCan the institute contribute in raising IDEA Lab through existing equipment?\n\nThe institution can shift permanently equipment/ tools they may be having with them to the IDEA Lab. However, they will not be included in the budget but reflected in the inventory.\n\nCan more than one institution join?\n\nThe utilization of facilities for the purpose they are given, to the maximum extent, is of paramount concern for AICTE. Towards this, institutions can come together under a lead institution which is eligible to apply. The Lab has to be in the premises of the lead institution which will be responsible for executing the project and ensuring that participating institutions and industries are not a liability on IDEA Lab/ Institution.\n\nCan the entire non-AICTE funding be from the institution?\n\nYes, the contribution can be from college but this is an excellent opportunity to reach out to industry inviting them for a national initiative. With gates opened for industry, the revenue generation and hence, prospects for sustenance of Lab enhance significantly. This is besides the live problems/ challenges they can offer to the colleges and technical experts as well.\n\nWho operates and manages IDEA Lab?\n\nThe Head of Institute will be the ex-officio Chief Mentor (CM) of the AICTE IDEA Lab, responsible for overall implementation of the project.\n\nHow are Student Ambassadors to be selected?\n\nStudents from the 3rd/ 4th year of UG or any year of PG course who show keen interest in the activities and regularly participate in them, can be nominated. Institute can frame its own set of rules for this. Upto 3 Ambassadors can be there at a time and should be rotated, maintaining gender equity.\n\nHow can other faculty make use of the facilities?\n\nIDEA Labis as much to be used by faculty, as students, including for their research work. They can work on their ideas independently or by involving students. They can create internship projects or practical work which require significant use of IDEA Lab and also facilities in their own departments. Working on interdisciplinary projects involving IDEA Lab would be appreciated.\n\nCan the institution put in place a committee for implementation of the IDEA Lab project?\n\nIt's the prerogative of the institution to have one, as an internal mechanism. However, it should in no way become an impediment, at any stage, in the functioning of the Lab.\n\nCan more than one industry join?\n\nAs long as interested industries are an asset and not a liability on IDEA Lab/ Institution, they are welcome to contribute and participate. They can be given preference over non-contributing industries, in making use of the facilities of IDEA Lab.\n\nCan we charge the users of IDEA Lab?\n\nUsers other than students and faculty can be charged. Revenue generation will be a performance indicator and is strongly encouraged, for sustenance of the Lab. Faculty/ teachers/ staff attending the courses organized by the Lab, which earn a certificate useful for career advancement, can be charged nominally. There can be differential charges for users of facilities and those for a course/ training.\n\nWhen and how will AICTE release funds?\n\nAICTE will release 80% of sanctioned amount as first instalment only after matching grant is deposited in the exclusive Bank Account of IDEA Lab and proof submitted. The second instalment of 20% will be released based on the (a) performance (b) utilization of AICTE's first instalment (c) deposition of 20% amount from non-AICTE sources and any other funds committed in the sanctioned project, besides other documents stipulated for fund release.\n\n[### Sources And References](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/aiideals#sources)\n\n[Guidelines](https://idealnet.aicte-india.org/assets/data/scheme_doc.pdf)\n\n[User Manual](https://idealnet.aicte-india.org/assets/data/user_manual.pdf)\n\n[FAQs](https://idealnet.aicte-india.org/assets/data/scheme_doc.pdf)\n\n[Official Website](https://idealnet.aicte-india.org/)\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n#### Share\n\n### Something went wrong.

As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can facilitate the students and faculty to \u201cengage, explore, experience, express and excel\u201d as desired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in the wake of release of National Educational Policy 2020,\n\n> **Purpose:**\n\n*   The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc. which conventional labs are not able to.\n\n*   The focus will be on training students so that they become imaginative and creative and stay so at the workplaces they join. The whole idea is to transform engineering education with such a Lab in all colleges and for this they must proactively expose all students to the IDEA Lab, organize training sessions for interested students as well as support projects and by providing online learning materials.\n\n> **Proposal:**\n\n*   As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation, mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty, utilization and expansion of facilities, etc.\n*   The alignment of activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge for any proposal.\n*   Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by AICTE.\n\n> **Implementation:**\n\nThe college/ educational campus/ university and industry are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE or even exceed it, in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally requires:\n\n*   An area of 5000 sq. ft.\n*   Should ideally remain open 24x7.\n*   To be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem.\n*   To hold workshops/ trainings, ideation sessions, boot-camps, competitions etc. and participate in similar activities organized by other IDEA Labs/ organizers and also in national/ international events so as to ensure that IDEA Lab is used productively and also extensively.\n*   To maintain the IDEA Lab, keep it well-furnished, take care of security, provide a safe working environment and stock adequate supplies of consumables.\n*   To provide necessary staff and all support facilities and amenities required to operate and maintain the Lab.\n*   To follow the guidelines issued by AICTE in the matter of IDEA Lab and other Government of India rules besides following the enunciated Code of Conduct (as in Annexures) in letter and spirit.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\nOk\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n\nNo new news and updates available\n\n\u00a92024\n\n[![Image 13: myScheme](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/)\n\nPowered by![Image 14](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/a01e597e35ed1eeaefa52c5d0c5fe71b)![Image 15: Digital India](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n\nDigital India Corporation(DIC)Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY)Government of India\u00ae\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n*   [About Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/about)\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/contact)\n*   [Screen Reader](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/screen-reader)\n*   [Accessibility Statement](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/accessibility-statement)\n*   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/faqs)\n*   [Disclaimer](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/disclaimer)\n*   [Terms & Conditions](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/terms-conditions)\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n\n*   ![Image 16: di](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 17: digilocker](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 18: umang](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 19: indiaGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 20: myGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 21: dataGov](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n*   ![Image 22: igod](blob:https://www.myscheme.gov.in/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n    \n\nGet in touch\n------------\n\n4th Floor, NeGD, Electronics Niketan, 6 CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi - 110003, India\n\nsupport-myscheme\\[at\\]digitalindia\\[dot\\]gov\\[dot\\]in\n\n(011) 24303714\n\nLast Updated On : 24/06/2024 | v-2.1.7\n"}]}}

Are Hamlets Eligible To Be Connected?\n\nThe spirit and objective of PMGSY-I was to provide good all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The unit of this programme is a habitation and not a revenue village or a Panchayat. A habitation is a cluster of population, living in an area, the location of which does not change over time. Desam, Dhanis, Tolas, Majras, Hamlets, etc. are commonly used to describe habitations. The population, as recorded in the Census 2001, shall be the basis for determining the population size of the habitation. The population of all Habitations within a radius of 500 metre (1.5 km of path distance in case of Hills) may be clubbed together to determine the population size. In the blocks bordering international boundary in the hill States (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs), however, all habitations within a path distance of 10 km may be treated as a cluster for this purpose. This cluster approach would enable the provision of connectivity to a number of Habitations, particularly in Hill/ mountainous areas. A special dispensation has been allowed to Arunachal Pradesh under PMGSY by extending the Cluster approach to all International border districts in the State by clubbing population with the path distance of 10 km and treating as a Cluster.\n\nHow Are Habitations Selected For Coverage? Who Decides Which Habitations Will Be Covered In A Year?\n\nUnconnected habitations are listed as per the priority (generally, habitations with a higher population, as per 2001 Census, would be connected first) and depending upon the funds likely to be made available for the State, the list of road works to be taken up under PMGSY-I will be finalized each year by the District Panchayat through a consultative process involving Panchayati Raj Institutions and elected representatives.\n\nCan An Individual Apply For Road Connectivity?\n\nThe objective of PMGSY-I was to provide road connectivity to unconnected habitations as mentioned in response to Question 1 above. Any proposal for road connectivity may be perceived as per the programme guidelines.\n\nHow Is Alignment Selected? Are Local Villagers Associated With This Process?\n\nA simple, non-formal transect walk shall be organised by the Assistant Engineer at the time of preparation of DPRs to finalise the alignment. The Panchayat Pradhan, local patwari, the JE, Local Revenue and Forest officials, Women PRI members and representatives of Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) also participate in the transect walk to determine the most suitable alignment, sort out the issues of land availability and to moderate any adverse social and environmental impact, eliciting necessary community participation in the programme. After transect walk, the minutes should be placed and approved by the Grama Sabha.Local people including those likely to be affected by proposed alignment are also allowed to put forth their view in this process.\n\nWhat Does All-Weather Connectivity Mean? Does It Mean Only Black- Topped Or Cement Concrete Roads?\n\nAn all-weather road is one that is negotiable in all seasons of the year. This implies that the road-bed is drained effectively but this does not necessarily imply that it should be paved surface with blacktopping or cement concrete. A gravel road can also be an all-weather road.\n\nHow Is The Problem Of Drainage Tackled In The Portion Of Roads Passing Through Built-Up Residential Areas?\n\nRoad portions passing through built-up residential areas are prone to damages caused by wastewater from households. Programme guidelines provide for the construction of cement concrete pavement or cement/stone block pavements along with covered or uncovered Pucca side drains as per site conditions.\n\nIs The Adequate Provision For Culverts Or Cross-Drainage Works Made?\n\nThe objective of the PMGSY is to provide an All-weather Road with necessary culverts and other cross drainage structures, which is operable throughout the year to the eligible unconnected habitations as per PMGSY guidelines in the rural areas. Rural roads constructed under PMGSY must have proper embankment and drainage. Adequate number and type of Cross Drainage (CD) works, including causeways, where appropriate, must be provided based on site requirements ascertained through necessary investigation. Minor bridges can be provided wherever necessary. A necessary advisory has been already issued to the State Governments to include the culverts/CDs bridges along with the road proposals. The proposal of long-span Bridges should be prepared as a separate DPR. However, such proposals of Bridges should be submitted with road proposals in the same batch.\n\nWhat About Bridges On Rivers/Streams?\n\nBridges on rivers/streams crossing the alignment of the road are taken up under the program along with the road proposal. The Ministry issued PMGSY-III guidelines increasing the span of Long-Span Bridges (LSBs) for funding under PMGSY as follows: Up to 200 m in respect of Special Category States and LWE districts identified by the MHA. Upto 150 m in respect of other States.\n\nWhether Compensation For Land Acquisition Is Paid In The Program?\n\nThe rural road is a State subject and it is the responsibility of State Government/ District Panchayat to ensure the availability of land for construction of road works under the programme. In view of the common benefit, generally, the land for construction of roads under PMGSY is made available by the villagers/Panchayat free of cost through voluntary donation. However, in rare cases, if the land is acquired for construction of roads under PMGSY, the State Government is required to pay compensation.\n\nHow Are Executants Selected For The Construction Of Roads?\n\nExecutants for construction of roads are selected through open competitive bidding for which well-established procedure for tendering is followed by the State Government. As per provisions, the bidders who have the prescribed qualifications and have the capacity to execute the works are required to take part in the bidding process. To enhance the transparency in tendering and speed up the tendering process, e- procurement of bids has been made mandatory.\n\nIf Defects Are Noticed After Completion Of The Road, How Are They Rectified?\n\nAs per provisions of the contract, the contractor is liable for any defect that may occur until 5 years after completion of the road work. To enforce liability of defects, the security amount is deducted from the bills of the contractors. The contractor has to rectify the defect in the above period and if the rectification has not been carried out, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is required to rectify the defect and recover the cost from the security deposit of the contractor.\n\nHow Is The Quality Of Work Checked And Monitored?\n\nEvery contractor is required to establish a field laboratory in every package of road works in which he/she required to test the quality of material and workmanship under the supervision of executing agency. In addition to checking of quality by departmental officers of executing agency, the State Government is required to deploy independent monitors for monitoring of the quality of road works. Independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are also deployed by the Central Government for monitoring the quality of works randomly.\n\nIs There A Provision For The Display Of Project-Related Information At Project Sites?\n\nCitizen Information Board in the local language containing the following detailed information of work is provided on each work:- Description of every layer of work. Description of the quantity of material involved in work. How the road will be built and description. General information board containing information about executing agency, contractor, estimated cost of work and time for completion is also provided on every worksite.\n\nWhat Is The Role Of Public Representatives In Checking The Quality Of Implementation Of The Programme?\n\nIn the interest of total transparency and to ensure the pro-active role of public representatives, the States have been advised to organize a time-bound inspection of road works with local public representatives in the following manner:- The Superintending Engineer would request the Hon\u2019ble M.P. and Zila Pramukh once in 6 months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized. The Executive Engineer would request the Hon\u2019ble MLA and Chairperson of Intermediate Panchayat once in three months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized. The Assistant Engineer would request the Sarpanch once in two months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.\n\nWhether Information About The Programme Is Available On Any Website?\n\nYes, information about the programme and details about every work is available on programme website www.omms.nic.in and www.pmgsy.nic.in.The Online Monitoring and Management System (OMMS) is being used for effective management and monitoring under the programme. The required data is entered by the field level staff and the State units under this web-based package.\n\nHow Are The Roads Maintained?\n\nAlong with the tendering for the construction the routine maintenance of road works for five years after completion of work is also included. Programme guidelines envisage a transfer of road works for maintenance to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) after 5 years upon completion of the road work.\n\nWhat Should Be The Population Of Habitations To Be Covered Under PMGSY-I For Providing Connectivity?\n\nThe programme envisages connecting all eligible unconnected habitations by way of an all-weather road as per Core Network with a population of 500 persons (as per 2001 Census) and above in plain areas and 250 persons and above (as per 2001 Census) in the Special Category States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttarakhand), Tribal (Schedule-V) areas, the Desert Areas (as identified in Desert Development Programme) and in Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs/Planning Commission). In the critical 267 Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (2001 census).\n"}]}}
