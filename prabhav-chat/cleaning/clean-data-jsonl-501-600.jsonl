Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to women of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families to find self-employment, whose husbands have died/abandoned, and who have to take care of their sons/children with severe physical and mental challenges.\n\nParents of severely mentally retarded and differently-abled persons require emotional strength and flexibility. Older parents can find themselves overwhelmed by various medical, caregiving, and financial responsibilities. Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded (PH/MR) persons always need special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else\u2019s assistance. Sometimes it can be quite challenging for older parents in BPL families, especially mothers, who have to take care of household tasks and work apart from taking care of MR persons.\n\nLooking after such a Mentally challenged/PH person is expensive. These expenses can arise from medical equipment and supplies, medical care, caregiving expenses, specialized transportation, etc. Even though an amount of \u20b9600/- is being provided as \u201cAswasakiranam Pension\u201d to caregivers (family members) of bedridden PH/MR persons, it cannot cover the expenses completely. Single mothers face tremendous challenges. Often, a custodial parent must fulfill the roles of primary provider and caregiver without the benefit of a partner.

The name Haritha Haram means \"green garland\" in Telugu, the official language of Telangana.\n\nThe main objective of the Haritha Haram programme is to increase the green cover of the state from the existing 24% to 33% by planting and nurturing millions of saplings every year. The programme also aims to create awareness among the public about the importance of preserving and protecting the environment.\n\nThe program was launched by Telangana Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao on 3 July 2015. It is one of the Telangana Flagship programmes to rejuvenate degraded forests, protecting these forests from threats such as smuggling, encroachment, fire and grazing. It adopted intensive soil and moisture conservation measures based on a watershed approach.\n\nIn the areas outside the existing forest, massive planting activities were to be taken up in areas such as; road-side avenues, river and canal banks, barren hills and foreshore areas, institutional premises, religious places, housing colonies, community lands, municipalities and industrial parks.\n\nSpecific duties and responsibilities are assigned to different committees to ensure the implementation of the programme in a well-designed way. These committees do regular field inspections and monitor the ongoing plantation and nursery works. The committees are the State-Level Steering Committee and the District-Level Monitoring and Coordination Committee.\n\nAt the village level, Haritha Rakshana Committees were formed to monitor the program under the Chairmanship of Gram Sarpanch.\n\nThe seedlings are monitored through geo-tagging. The Forest Department posts survival percentage details on the Department.\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/haritha-haram#benefits)\n\nThe Haritha Haram programme has several benefits, including:\n\n1.  **Increased green cover:** The main objective of the programme is to increase the green cover in Telangana, which has several benefits, such as improving air quality, reducing soil erosion, and providing habitat for wildlife.\n2.  **Mitigation of climate change:** Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. By increasing the green cover, the Haritha Haram programme can help mitigate the effects of climate change.\n3.  **Soil conservation:** Trees play a critical role in conserving soil by reducing soil erosion, improving soil quality, and preventing desertification.\n4.  **Water conservation:** Trees help to conserve water by reducing soil erosion, improving the water-holding capacity of soil, and reducing evaporation.\n5.  **Biodiversity conservation:** By increasing the green cover, the Haritha Haram programme can provide habitat for a variety of plant and animal species, thereby promoting biodiversity conservation.\n6.  **Economic benefits:** The programme can generate economic benefits through the creation of employment opportunities in the forestry sector, as well as through the production of non-timber forest products such as fruits, nuts, and medicinal plants.\n7.  **Health benefits:** Trees have been shown to have a positive impact on human health by improving air quality and reducing stress levels.\n\nOverall, the Haritha Haram programme has several benefits for the environment, economy, and human health, and has been successful in achieving its objectives of increasing the green cover and promoting environmental conservation in Telangana.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/haritha-haram#eligibility)\n\nHaritha Haram is a flagship program initiated by the government of Telangana in India, aimed at increasing the green cover in the state.

The name Haritha Haram means \"green garland\" in Telugu, the official language of Telangana.\n\nThe main objective of the Haritha Haram programme is to increase the green cover of the state from the existing 24% to 33% by planting and nurturing millions of saplings every year. The programme also aims to create awareness among the public about the importance of preserving and protecting the environment.\n\nThe program was launched by Telangana Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao on 3 July 2015. It is one of the Telangana Flagship programmes to rejuvenate degraded forests, protecting these forests from threats such as smuggling, encroachment, fire and grazing. It adopted intensive soil and moisture conservation measures based on a watershed approach.\n\nIn the areas outside the existing forest, massive planting activities were to be taken up in areas such as; road-side avenues, river and canal banks, barren hills and foreshore areas, institutional premises, religious places, housing colonies, community lands, municipalities and industrial parks.\n\nSpecific duties and responsibilities are assigned to different committees to ensure the implementation of the programme in a well-designed way. These committees do regular field inspections and monitor the ongoing plantation and nursery works. The committees are the State-Level Steering Committee and the District-Level Monitoring and Coordination Committee.\n\nAt the village level, Haritha Rakshana Committees were formed to monitor the program under the Chairmanship of Gram Sarpanch.\n\nThe seedlings are monitored through geo-tagging. The Forest Department posts survival percentage details on the Department.\n\n#### Share\n\n#### News and Updates\n"}]}}

The credit linked subsidy will be available only for loan amounts upto Rs. 9 lakhs for MIG-I and Rs 12 lakhs for MIG-II and such loans would be eligible for an interest subsidy at the rate of 4 % and 3% respectively for a tenure of 20 years or during tenure of loan whichever is lower. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the interest subsidy will be calculated at a discount rate of 9%. Any additional loan amount beyond the limit will be at non-subsidized rate. However, the carpet area of the house should be strictly restricted within the permissible carpet area of 160 sq m and 200 sq m for MIG-I and MIG-II categories respectively.\n\nWhat are the income norms for various categories?\n\nMIG I households with an annual income more than Rs.6 lakh and up to Rs.12 lakh. MIG II households with an annual income more than Rs. 12 lakh and up to Rs. 18 lakh.\n\nWhen was the PMAY scheme launched by the Government for MIG?\n\nCLSS under vertical of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana -Urban for Middle Income Groups was launched by the Government of India with the effect from January 1, 2017.\n\nWhat is the process of crediting the interest subsidy?\n\nThe subsidy is released by the CNAs based on the disbursements made by PLIs to the beneficiaries. Subsidy, disbursed by the CNA to the PLI, is credited by the PLI to the borrower's home loan account upfront by deducting it from the principal loan amount. As a result, the borrower will pay EMI on the remainder of the principal loan amount.\n\nWhat is the role of States/ UTs/ ULBs for Affordable Housing through Credit Linked Subsidy scheme?\n\nRole of States/UTs/ULBs under this vertical would be as under: States/UTs/ULBs/PLIs shall ensure link beneficiary identification through Aadhaar for de-duplication. State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA) identified by State/UT for implementing the PMAY(U) will facilitate the identified eligible beneficiaries in getting approvals and documents, etc. to avail of Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme.\n\nWho are the Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) and what is their role in disbursal of subsidy under CLSS to PLIs?\n\nAs of now, HUDCO, NHB and SBI have been identified as CNAs to channelize the credit linked subsidy to the PLIs and monitor the progress of CLSS. Ministry may notify other Institutions as CNA in future.\n\nWhich are the PLIs through whom this interest subsidy is released or credited?\n\nPrimary Lending Institutions such as Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCB), Housing Finance Companies (HFCs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), State Cooperative Banks, Urban Cooperative Banks (Scheduled as well as Non-scheduled), Small Finance Banks (as approved by the Reserve Bank of India) and Non-Banking Financial Company-Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs) (as registered with Reserve Bank of India) which have signed MoUs with any one of the CNAs.\n\nWhether PLIs have to sign MoUs with CNAs for claiming subsidies?\n\nYes, PLIs can register with any CAN after signing MoU as provided in Annexure-I in the PMAY (U) guidelines.\n\nHow subsidy is disbursed to the CNAs?\n\nAn advance subsidy is released to each CNA at the start of the scheme. Subsequent amount of credit linked subsidy will be released to the CNAs after 70% utilization of earlier amounts based on claims raised by CNAs.\n\nIs there any preferential treatment for beneficiaries proposed for Affordable Housing through Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme?\n\nYes, Preference under the CLSS will be given to Manual Scavengers, Women (with overriding preference to widows), persons belonging to Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes/ Other Backward Classes, Minorities, Persons with disabilities and Transgenders subject to beneficiaries being from EWS / LIG, MIG -I & II segments as applicable.\n\nWhat happens when the subsidy has already been disbursed, but due to certain reasons, the construction of the house is stalled?\n\nIn cases where the construction of house is not completed within 36 months from the date of release of the first disbursement, subsidy is to be recovered by the PLI and refunded to the CNA who had released the subsidy.\n\nSince the subsidy is released to the PLI post claim, does it mean that PLI has to charge the EMI on the entire loan amount and after the CLSS claim amount is released, adjust the same to the loan and thereafter calculate the revised EMI payable by the beneficiary?\n\nYes\n\nIs there any limit or upper cap on the value (Cost) of the property for which home loan can be availed?\n\nNo.\n\nWhere can we get list of approved Towns where the scheme is operational?\n\nThe list of Statutory Towns along with any other towns notified subsequently is provided through CNAs and may be accessed on the website of the CNAs and PMAY(U).\n\nThe disbursal of subsidy amount is in maximum of 4 instalments whereas a builder could demand construction linked instalments in more than this number. How to deal with such cases?\n\nIn such cases, the number of disbursal instalments can be decided based on the discussions between CNAs and PLIs for availing the benefit under the CLSS, provided all other requirements of the scheme are complied with.\n\nWhether MoHUA is contemplating to share the burden, where a loan becomes NPA and the PLI concerned is unable to recover the entire outstanding amount from the beneficiaries?\n\nIt is the responsibility of the PLIs to carry out due diligence of the borrower as per their due diligence norms and as such recovery of NPAs, if any, is their responsibility. However, where the construction of the unit is stalled due to any reason, the subsidy released by MoHUA is to be recovered along with loan recovery by the PLI.\n\nIs there any State Government sponsorship or approval required for availing benefits under this scheme for Private Developers?\n\nNo\n\nIs resale from (builder/seller) allowed under CLSS?\n\nResale cases would be allowed but it is incumbent upon banks to adopt their due diligence and banking mechanism processes to curtail speculative cases in this scenario.\n\nCan NRIs be considered under this scheme?\n\nNRIs can be considered provided they are eligible under the Scheme Guidelines and are also in compliance with other GoI/RBI rules, if any, applicable to NRIs.\n\nWhether PLIs can fix the repayment tenure of more than 20 years to benefit eligible loanees under the scheme?\n\nThe interest subsidy will be for tenure of 20 years or during the tenure of the loan whichever is lower. PLIs can fix the repayment tenure of more than 20 years, but the interest subsidy will be calculated for tenure upto 20 years.\n\nWhat is the maximum tenure on which the credit linked subsidy is applicable?\n\nThe credit linked subsidy is available for a maximum tenure of 20 years or the actual tenure of loan, whichever is less.\n\nIs there any loan amount limit for CLSS availing benefit under?\n\nNo, there is no loan amount limit for loan accounts which are booked under CLSS. However, subsidy will be restricted to the loan amount of 9 Lakh and Rs.12 Lakh for MIG-I & MIG-II respectively.\n\nAre there any additional eligibility norms apart from income, first pucca house and carpet area norms?\n\nThe property on which the subsidy is to be availed has to have Basic amenities such as water, sanitation, sewerage, roads, electricity etc. Property must be located at Statutory Towns as per Census 2011 and towns notified subsequently, including Notified Planning/ Development Areas.\n\nCan a beneficiary having his/her own business; avail Home Loan under CLSS?\n\nYes, beneficiary can avail this facility, subject to meeting the income and other criteria defined under this scheme.\n\nCan an unmarried adult earning person is eligible for CLSS subsidy?\n\nYes. He/she can be considered as a separate household provided he/she avails the loan only in his/her own name and is also the sole owner of the property for which the loan is availed.\n"}]}}
