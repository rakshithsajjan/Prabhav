It encompasses the net income highlighted in these returns for all the years covered in the claimed period. The certified copy from the auditor or Chartered Accountant further certifies the accuracy of this reported income.\n\nCould you elaborate on the significance of the cap of \u20b9 25,00,000 mentioned in relation to the performance grant of 5% of the reported net income?\n\nThe cap of \u20b9 25,00,000 serves as an upper limit on the performance grant, ensuring that regardless of the calculated 5% of the reported net income, the grant does not exceed this specified amount. This is a crucial detail to consider when assessing the potential benefits and limitations of the policy.\n\nIn the context of the y-o-y growth requirement, how should a situation where a company experiences a decline in turnover for one of the three consecutive years be addressed?\n\nThe guideline stipulates a record growth of 15% y-o-y turnover for any three consecutive years. In the event of a decline in turnover for one of these years, it may impact the eligibility. However, it's recommended to carefully review the specific circumstances, as exceptions or considerations might apply based on the nature and context of the decline.\n\nWhere Can I Find The Link To The Scheme Guidelines?\n\nYou can access the comprehensive Scheme Guidelines, which provide intricate details and instructions, at the following web address: https://www.goa.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ITPolicySchemes2018.pdf\n\nIs There Any Compensation For The Delay In The Disbursal Of The Scheme Benefits?\n\nThe guidelines do not mention any provision for compensation in the event of delayed disbursement of scheme benefits.\n\nCan Applicants From The Neighboring States Also Apply To This Scheme?\n\nThis scheme is exclusively available to permanent residents of the state. Applicants from neighboring states, among others, are not eligible to apply.\n\nWhat is the link to the Official Web Portal of Goa Online?\n\nThe link to the Official Web Portal of Goa Online is https://goaonline.gov.in/\n\nWhat is the tentative timeline for the Issue of Regret Letter/Sanction Orders and Disbursement?\n\nThe timeline for the Application approval by the Empowered Committee is 90 days from the receipt of the Application.\n\nWhat is the full form of GST - TIN?\n\nThe full form of GST TIN is Goods and Services Tax - Tax Identification Number.\n\nAre the benefits under this scheme guaranteed?\n\nThe benefits under this scheme are subject to budgetary allocation. No Promisory Estoppel shall be applicable if benefits are discontinued in case allocation is exceeded.\n\nIs it mandatory for the applicant units, both new and existing, to have their operations in Goa?\n\nYes, in order to be eligible to apply for this scheme, the New and Existing Units must have their operations in Goa.\n\nWhat are the objectives of the Information Technology Policy of Goa?\n\nGoa's IT Policy envisages Goa as an aspirational geographical and human resource base for IT Units and a preferred destination for their investment and expansion.\n"}]}}

The subsidy is provided on a first-come-first-serve basis, and the number of rams provided under the scheme is limited.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nSheep rearing is one of the main occupations of the people in Himachal Pradesh. Rampur Bushari and Gaddi breeds of Himachal Pradesh are famous for indigenous carpet wool production in the Country. The total sheep population in the State is 8.05 lakh. As per norms, one breeding ram is required per 20-25 sheep. keeping in view a breedable population of approx. 3.00 lakh sheep in the State, at least 12,000 rams are required, whereas the department is able to provide only 250-300 rams from its Farms. Hence, it is being proposed to provide High Genetic Merit breeding rams of Rambouillet and Russian Merino breeds and their crosses in a phased manner after purchasing from Farms/progressive breeders of the state and neighboring States and to provide these to sheep breeders at 60% subsidy.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**The objective of the Scheme:**\n\n1.  Genetic improvement of indigenous Sheep breeds and dissemination of Superior Germplasm amongst the migratory flocks of sheep in H.P.\n2.  _To improve the Quality and Quantity of meat and wool being produced in the state, thereby ensuring better economic returns to the Sheep Breeders._\n3.  To resolve the problem of inbreeding amongst the migratory sheep flocks of Tribal Sheep Breeders.\n\n\ufeff\n\n_**Key features:**_\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.  **Subsidized Rams:** The scheme provides rams of superior breeds at subsidized rates to eligible sheep breeders.\n2.  **Superior Breeds:** The rams provided under the scheme are of superior breeds such as Merino, Rambouillet, and Hampshire.\n3.  **Eligibility Criteria:** The scheme is open to all registered sheep breeders in Himachal Pradesh.\n\n\ufeff\n\n_Overall, the Scheme of Provision of subsidized Rams to Sheep Breeders in Himachal Pradesh is a helpful program for sheep breeders who want to adopt modern and scientific methods of sheep breeding. By providing them with superior breed rams at subsidized rates, the scheme aims to increase the productivity and profitability of sheep farming in the state._\n\n\ufeff\n\n[### Benefits](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/rams-to-sheep-breeders#benefits)\n\nThis Scheme of Provision of subsidized Rams to Sheep Breeders in Himachal Pradesh can benefit sheep breeders in the state by providing access to superior breed rams, increasing productivity and profitability, and promoting the adoption of modern and scientific methods of sheep breeding.\n\n\ufeff\n\n**Some of the key benefits of this scheme are:**\n\n**Access to superior breed rams:** The scheme provides access to high-quality rams of superior breeds such as Merino, Rambouillet, and Hampshire, which can improve the genetic potential of the sheep population and enhance their productivity.\n\n**Affordable rates:** The rams are provided at subsidized rates, which makes them more affordable for sheep breeders who may not have the financial resources to purchase them at market rates.\n\n**Increased productivity:** By providing access to superior breed rams, the scheme can increase the productivity of the sheep population, which can lead to higher wool and meat yields.\n\n**Improved profitability:** The scheme can lead to improved profitability for sheep breeders as higher productivity can result in higher revenues and reduced costs.\n\n**Adoption of modern methods:** The scheme encourages sheep breeders to adopt modern and scientific methods of sheep breeding, which can result in more efficient and effective breeding practices.\n\n**Employment generation:** The scheme can also generate employment opportunities in the sheep farming sector, as increased productivity can lead to increased demand for labor in areas such as shearing, wool sorting, and meat processing.\n\n[### Eligibility](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/rams-to-sheep-breeders#eligibility)\n\nThe eligibility criteria for the Scheme of Provision of subsidized Rams to Sheep Breeders in Himachal Pradesh may vary based on the specific guidelines and criteria set by the implementing agency of the scheme. However, here are some general eligibility descriptions given by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Himachal Pradesh:\n\n\ufeff\n\n1.

Can the fellow be paid 50/50 by both institutions?\n\nNo, the TARE awardee is expected to do research on his / her own.\n\nIf I succeed in getting the TARE grant, can I apply for, say, an extramural grant later?\n\nApplicant should not hold any ongoing research projects or any fellowship at the time of submission of application. You are not eligible to avail of any other project from DST/SERB until you complete the TARE project.\n"}]}}
