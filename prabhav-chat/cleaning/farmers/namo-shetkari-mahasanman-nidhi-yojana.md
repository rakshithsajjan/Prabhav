I am not able to register the farmer on the portal. It says Aadhar No. is already registered. How do I proceed?

It might happen that the farmer has already registered himself on the PM-KISAN portal via self-registration mode. In such cases, you may check if the farmer has self-registered under the “Status of Self- Registration/CSC Farmers” on the home page of PM-KISAN Portal in the Farmer’s Corner section.

A farmer has been wrongly rejected due to some errors in the application. I am not able to register the farmer via direct data entry on PM-KISAN portal. How do I proceed?

In such cases, the farmer must edit/update/re-submit his application via “Updation of Self-Registration” window in the Farmer’s Corner on the PM-KISAN Portal. If farmer is registered through CSC, farmer has to contact nearby CSC centre for updation. Once re-submitted/edited, the farmer application will again be sent to the State for approval/validation.

A farmer has wrongly entered some details during self-registration via CSC. When the farmer tries to edit the application, the record is not available. How to proceed?

The record will be available for correction on the same user id via which the farmer was registered. Hence, a farmer who has registered via CSC - A, cannot go for editing his application to CSC - B.

Is it mandatory for a farmer to enter the land records details to register under PM-KISAN?
