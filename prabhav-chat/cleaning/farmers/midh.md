National Horticulture Mission (NHM) was launched in the year 2005-06 and aims at the holistic development of the horticulture sector by ensuring forward and backward linkage through a cluster approach with the active participation of all stakeholders. Major interventions under NHM include, supply of quality planting material through establishment of nurseries and tissue culture units, production and productivity improvement programmes through area expansion and rejuvenation, technology promotion, technology dissemination, human resource development, creation of infrastructure for post harvest management and marketing in consonance with the comparative advantages of each State/region and their diverse agro-climatic conditions.

﻿

Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH) aims to achieve overall development of Horticulture in NE and Himalayan states. The mission covers all NE States including Sikkim and three Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

﻿

• Encourage aggregation of farmers into farmer groups like FIGs/FPOs and FPCs to bring economy of scale and scope.

• Enhance horticulture production, augment farmers, income and strengthen nutritional security;

• Improve productivity by way of quality germplasm, planting material and water use efficiency through Micro Irrigation.

• Support skill development and create employment generation opportunities for rural youth in horticulture and post-harvest management, especially in the cold chain sector.

Under MIDH, financial assistance is provided for following major interventions/activities:

• Setting up of nurseries, tissue culture units for production of quality seed and planting material.

• Area expansion i.e. Establishment of new orchards and gardens for fruits, vegetables, and flowers.

• Rejuvenation of unproductive, old, and senile orchards.

• Protected cultivation, i.e. poly-house, green-house, etc, to improve the productivity & grow off season high value vegetables and flowers.
