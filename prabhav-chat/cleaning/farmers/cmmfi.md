[### Details](https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/cmmfi#details)

**Detailed**

The Union Minister, of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman and the Chief Minister of Nagaland Neiphiu Rio jointly launched the Chief Minister’s Micro Finance Initiative at Capital Cultural Hall, Kohima on 23rd August 2022.

The scheme aims to enhance farmers’ income by increasing investment in agriculture and allied sector, improving agri-marketing networks and infrastructure, promoting credit discipline and boosting private enterprise. The Chief Minister's Micro-finance Initiative will help hardworking farmers and young entrepreneurs get credit. Individuals, Self Help Groups, and Farmer Producer Organizations will benefit from the initiative, which aims to make credit more inexpensive and accessible. To that end, he stated that the government will grant either a subsidy or an interest subsidy to specified activities in agriculture and associated sectors, such as processing units, handicrafts, and small-scale manufacturing.

Additional interest subvention would be offered in addition to what is already available under existing Central Government schemes. The programme will assist farmers in increasing their revenues, promoting credit discipline, encouraging private entrepreneurship, and improving our state's agri-marketing network and infrastructure.

Beneficiaries will be chosen by District Level Selection Committees, with Village Councils acting as guarantors when necessary. The scheme's precise framework will be announced separately.

The eligible beneficiaries for the scheme are farmers, entrepreneurs, Self Help Groups, Farmer Producer Organisations/companies and cooperative societies. The eligible schemes are the construction of circular eco-hatchery, rejuvenation of animal husbandry through credit linkage, procurement of transport vehicles for agriculture products, integrated farming system, horticulture crop loan scheme and microfinance scheme for micro-enterprises.

*   **Individual Farmers** who are keen to invest in agri-allied and other activities for a better livelihood would be assisted as per the norms of the Scheme.

*   **Self-Help Groups:** SHGs have been a key element of credit extension to the poor and small entrepreneurs. They undertake activities in a group mode which benefits the community as well as provides meaningful livelihood opportunities to the members. SHGs have been supported under various programs being implemented in the State. The Government of Nagaland endeavours to further support the SHGs through this scheme to expand the scope of economic activities that can supplement the needs, especially of the rural household.

*   **Farmer Producer Organizations** (Registered under Societies Act, Co-operative Societies Act or Company Act): Farmer Producer Organizations are Farmers’ Collectives, and with characteristics of legal personality and limited liability similar to a company, can attract investments, modern technology, catalyse aggregating and marketing of bulk produce to fetch better remuneration and in turn lead to improved means of production. Although very few in number at present, in the state, they present huge opportunities and have been considered eligible entities under the scheme.
