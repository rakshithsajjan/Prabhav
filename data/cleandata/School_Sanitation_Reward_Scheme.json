        "details": "The Government of Himachal Pradesh has implemented a comprehensive strategy, known as the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), to address the sanitation challenges in rural areas. This strategy has led to significant progress, with the state achieving almost universal sanitation coverage and all Panchayats claiming Open Defecation Free (ODF) status. To further incentivize and acknowledge exceptional efforts in the field of sanitation, the government introduced the Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP), Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorna Swachata Puraskar (MVSSP), and the School Sanitation Reward Scheme. The School Sanitation Reward Scheme aims to enhance sanitation facilities and promote hygiene education in schools. Schools that meet the eligibility criteria, including the availability of toilets, urinals, hand washing facilities, safe drinking water, and waste management systems, can participate in the scheme. Assessment committees are formed at the block and district levels to evaluate schools based on specific criteria, and winners are selected accordingly. The scheme provides cash awards and certificates of appreciation to the cleanest primary, middle, and high/senior secondary schools at both block and district levels. The prize money is intended to be utilized for further improving sanitation facilities within the winning schools.",
