        "details": "The Skill Development Initiative Scheme (SDIS) or Modular Employable Skills (MES) under the Indian government is aimed at improving the employability of the Indian workforce by providing vocational training. The majority of the Indian workforce lacks marketable skills, with only 5% obtaining formal vocational training. The SDIS is a public-private partnership between the government and industry to promote skills development programs for early school dropouts and existing workers, especially in the unorganized sector. The main goal is to provide employable skills and test and certify existing skills for school leavers, workers, ITI graduates, etc. The priority is given to those above 14 years of age who have been withdrawn as child labor. The SDIS aims to bring transparency and gather valuable feedback from stakeholders and the public.",
