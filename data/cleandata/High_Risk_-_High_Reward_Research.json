        "details": "The Scheme 'High Risk - High Reward Research' is implemented by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India with the aim to support proposals that are conceptually new and risky, and if successful, expected to have a paradigm-shifting influence on the S&T. This may be in terms of formulating a new hypothesis, or scientific breakthroughs which aid in emergence of new technologies. The scheme is aimed at supporting proposals that are new, challenge existing hypothesis, and provide 'out of box' thinking on important problems. It should contain significant risk elements but promise of high reward if the difficulties could be circumvented. It is expected that the success of such proposals will have far-reaching implications in S&T. Outcome could be new and significant theoretical or experimental advances, formulation of new hypothesis, or breakthrough science which will lead to new technologies. Proposals that address scientific issues which will result in 'incremental' knowledge will not be supported. Ideally, the proposal must contain bold research ideas which will have wide-ranging impact and potential for new scientific and technological innovations. The funding is provided normally for a period of three years. In exceptional cases, the duration can be up to 5 years as assessed by the expert committee.",

Select the scheme 'High Risk High Reward (HRR)' and Click on the 'Start Submission' Button. If you have CO-PI in your proposal then it is to be ensured that all the CO-PI are registered in the SERB online portal and have filled all mandatory fields in the 'Profile Details' section under 'Menu' ->'User Profile' after login. Some of the details of your proposal like Project Title (max 500 characters), Project summary (max 3000 characters), Keywords (max 6), Objectives of the project (max 1500 characters), Expected output, and outcome of the proposal (max 1500 characters), Budget (Research Personnel, Consumables, Travel, Equipment, Contingency, Overheads) have to be entered at the time of proposal submission. The proposals will be evaluated through peer review processes as approved by the Board.",

However, in HRHR projects, the risks associated to address the proposed scientific issues are high, and if it is successfully solved, should result in high reward."
