        "details": "The Karnataka Forest Department launched the 'Krushi Aranya Protsaha Yojane (KAPY)' program in 2011-12 to encourage farmers and the general public to increase forest and tree cover. The program provides subsidized seedlings to farmers for planting on their lands. Farmers are paid an incentive of Rs 35 for every surviving seedling at the end of the first year, Rs 40 after the completion of the second year, and Rs 50 after the completion of the third year. This is done to encourage the farmers to nurture the seedlings for at least three years. The amount of money provided as an incentive (Rs 125/- per seedling) more than compensates the cost incurred by the farmer in procuring and planting the seedling. The incentive is quite substantial when the farmer plants more seedlings. In addition to the financial incentive, the farmers are entitled to get handsome returns from the grown-up trees in the form of fruits, seeds, fodder, firewood, pole, timber, and other useful products.",
