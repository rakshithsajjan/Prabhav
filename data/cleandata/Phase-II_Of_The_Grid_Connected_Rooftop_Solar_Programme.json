                "question": "What are the advantages of Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar System?",
                "answer": "Saving on electricity bill by the consumer. Utilization of available vacant roof space, no additional land required. Low gestation period. No additional requirement of transmission and distribution (T&D) lines. Reduces T&D losses as power consumption and generation are collocated. Improvement in the tail-end grid voltages and reduction of system congestion. Long term energy and ecological security by reduction in carbon emission. Better management of daytime peak loads by DISCOM/ utility. Meeting of the Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) of obligated entities."
